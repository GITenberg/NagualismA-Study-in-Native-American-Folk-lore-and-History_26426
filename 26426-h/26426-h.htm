<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_1" id="section_1"></a><b>1.</b> The words, a <i>nagual</i>, <i>nagualism</i>, a <i>nagualist</i>, have been current
in English prose for more than seventy years; they are found during that
time in a variety of books published in England and the United
States,<a name="FNanchor_4-1_1" id="FNanchor_4-1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_4-1_1" class="fnanchor">4-*</a> yet are not to be discovered in any dictionary of the
English language; nor has <i>Nagualism</i> a place in any of the numerous
encyclop&aelig;dias or &#8220;Conversation Lexicons,&#8221; in English, French, German or
Spanish.</p>

<p>This is not owing to its lack of importance, since for two hundred years
past, as I shall show, it has been recognized as a cult, no less
powerful than mysterious, which united many and diverse tribes of Mexico
and Central America into organized opposition against the government and
the religion which had been introduced from Europe; whose members had
acquired and were bound together by strange faculties and an occult
learning, which placed them on a par with the famed thaumaturgists and
theodidacts of the Old World; and which preserved even into our own days
the thoughts and forms of a long suppressed ritual.</p>

<p>In several previous publications I have referred briefly to this secret
sodality and its aims,<a name="FNanchor_4-2_2" id="FNanchor_4-2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_4-2_2" class="fnanchor">4-&#8224;</a> and now believe it worth while to collect
my scattered notes and present all that I have found of value about the
origin, aims and significance of this Eleusinian Mystery of America. I
shall trace its geographical extension and endeavor to discover what its
secret influence really was and is.</p>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_2" id="section_2"></a><b>2.</b> The earliest description I find of its particular rites is that which
the historian Herrera gives, as they prevailed in 1530, in the province
of Cerquin, in the mountainous parts of Honduras. It is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The Devil was accustomed to deceive these natives by appearing to
them in the form of a lion, tiger, coyote, lizard, snake, bird, or
other animal. To these appearances they apply the name <i>Naguales</i>,
which is as much as to say, guardians or companions; and when such
an animal dies, so does the Indian to whom it was assigned. The way
such an alliance was formed was thus: The Indian repaired to some
very retired spot<span class='pagenum' style="font-size: 89%;"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span> and there appealed to the streams, rocks and
trees around him, and weeping, implored for himself the favors they
had conferred on his ancestors. He then sacrificed a dog or a fowl,
and drew blood from his tongue, or his ears, or other parts of his
body, and turned to sleep. Either in his dreams or half awake, he
would see some one of those animals or birds above mentioned, who
would say to him, &#8216;On such a day go hunting and the first animal or
bird you see will be my form, and I shall remain your companion and
<i>Nagual</i> for all time.&#8217; Thus their friendship became so close that
when one died so did the other; and without such a <i>Nagual</i> the
natives believe no one can become rich or powerful.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_5-1_3" id="FNanchor_5-1_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_5-1_3" class="fnanchor">5-*</a></p></div>

<p>This province of Cerquin appears to have been peopled by a tribe which
belonged to the great Mayan stock, akin to those which occupied most of
the area of what is now Yucatan, Tabasco, Chiapas and Guatemala.<a name="FNanchor_5-2_4" id="FNanchor_5-2_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_5-2_4" class="fnanchor">5-&#8224;</a>
I shall say something later about the legendary enchantress whom their
traditions recalled as the teacher of their ancestors and the founder of
their nation. What I would now call attention to is the fact that in
none of the dialects of the specifically Mexican or Aztecan stock of
languages do we find the word <i>nagual</i> in the sense in which it is
employed in the above extract, and this is strong evidence that the
origin of Nagualism is not to be sought in that stock.</p>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_3" id="section_3"></a><b>3.</b> We do find, however, in the Nahuatl language, which is the proper
name of the Aztecan, a number of derivatives from the same root, <i>na</i>,
among them this very word, <i>Nahuatl</i>, all of them containing the idea
&#8220;to know,&#8221; or &#8220;knowledge.&#8221; The early missionaries to New Spain often
speak of the <i>naualli</i> (plural, <i>nanahualtin</i>), masters of mystic
knowledge, dealers in the black art, wizards or sorcerers. They were not
always evil-minded persons, though they seem to have been generally
feared. The earliest source of information about them is Father Sahagun,
who, in his invaluable History, has the following paragraph:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The <i>naualli</i>, or magician, is he who frightens men and sucks the
blood of children during the night. He is well skilled in the
practice of this trade, he knows all the arts of sorcery
(<i>nauallotl</i>) and employs them with cunning and ability; but for
the benefit of men only, not for their<span class='pagenum' style="font-size: 89%;"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span> injury. Those who have
recourse to such arts for evil intents injure the bodies of their
victims, cause them to lose their reason and smother them. These
are wicked men and necromancers.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_6-1_5" id="FNanchor_6-1_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_6-1_5" class="fnanchor">6-*</a></p></div>

<p>It is evident on examining the later works of the Roman clergy in Mexico
that the Church did not look with any such lenient eye on the possibly
harmless, or even beneficial, exercise of these magical devices. We find
a further explanation of what they were, preserved in a work of
instruction to confessors, published by Father Juan Bautista, at Mexico,
in the year 1600.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;There are magicians who call themselves <i>teciuhtlazque</i>,<a name="FNanchor_6-2_6" id="FNanchor_6-2_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6-2_6" class="fnanchor">6-&#8224;</a>
and also by the term <i>nanahualtin</i>, who conjure the clouds when
there is danger of hail, so that the crops may not be injured. They
can also make a stick look like a serpent, a mat like a centipede,
a piece of stone like a scorpion, and similar deceptions. Others of
these <i>nanahualtin</i> will transform themselves to all appearances
(segun la aparencia), into a tiger, a dog or a weasel. Others again
will take the form of an owl, a cock, or a weasel; and when one is
preparing to seize them, they will appear now as a cock, now as an
owl, and again as a weasel. These call themselves
<i>nanahualtin</i>.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_6-3_7" id="FNanchor_6-3_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_6-3_7" class="fnanchor">6-&#8225;</a></p></div>

<p>There is an evident attempt in this somewhat confused statement to
distinguish between an actual transformation, and one which only appears
such to the observer.</p>

<p>In another work of similar character, published at Mexico a few years
later, the &#8220;Road to Heaven,&#8221; of Father Nicolas de Leon, we find a series
of questions which a confessor should put to any of his flock suspected
of these necromantic practices. They reveal to us quite clearly what
these occult practitioners were believed to do. The passage reads as
follows, the questions being put in the mouth of the priest:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Art thou a soothsayer? Dost thou foretell events by reading signs,
or by interpreting dreams, or by water, making circles and figures
on its surface? Dost thou sweep and ornament with flower garlands
the places where idols are preserved? Dost thou know certain words
with which to conjure for success in hunting, or to bring rain?</p>

<p>&#8220;Dost thou suck the blood of others, or dost thou wander about at
night, calling upon the Demon to help thee? Hast thou drunk
<i>peyotl</i>, or hast thou given it to others to drink, in order to
find out secrets, or to discover where stolen or lost articles
were? Dost thou know how to speak to vipers in such words that they
obey thee?&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_6-4_8" id="FNanchor_6-4_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_6-4_8" class="fnanchor">6-&sect;</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_4" id="section_4"></a><b>4.</b> This interesting passage lets in considerable light on the claims and
practices of the nagualists. Not the least important item is that of
their use of the intoxicant, <i>peyotl</i>, a decoction of which it appears
played a prominent part in their ceremonies. This is the native Nahuatl
name of a certain plant, having a white, tuberous root, which is the
part employed. It is mentioned as &#8220;pellote&#8221; or &#8220;peyote&#8221; in the
<i>Farmacopea Mexicana</i> as a popular remedy, but its botanical name is not
added. According to Paso y Troncoso, it is one of the Composit&aelig;, a
species of the genus <i>Cacalia</i>.<a name="FNanchor_7-1_9" id="FNanchor_7-1_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_7-1_9" class="fnanchor">7-*</a> It is referred to in several
passages by Father Sahagun, who says that it grows in southern Mexico,
and that the Aztecs derived their knowledge of it from the older
&#8220;Chichimecs.&#8221; It was used as an intoxicant.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Those who eat or drink of this <i>peyotl</i> see visions, which are
sometimes frightful and sometimes ludicrous. The intoxication it
causes lasts several days. The Chichimecs believed that it gave
them courage in time of danger and diminished the pangs of hunger
and thirst.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_7-2_10" id="FNanchor_7-2_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_7-2_10" class="fnanchor">7-&#8224;</a></p></div>

<p>Its use was continued until a late date, and very probably has not yet
died out. Its composition and method of preparation are given in a list
of beverages prohibited by the Spanish authorities in the year 1784, as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;<i>Peyote</i>: Made from a species of vinagrilla, about the size of a
billiard ball, which grows in dry and sterile soil. The natives
chew it, and throw it into a wooden mortar, where it is left to
ferment, some leaves of tobacco being added to give it pungency.
They consume it in this form, sometimes with slices of <i>peyote</i>
itself, in their most solemn festivities, although it dulls the
intellect and induces gloomy and hurtful visions (sombras muy
funestas).&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_7-3_11" id="FNanchor_7-3_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_7-3_11" class="fnanchor">7-&#8225;</a></p></div>

<p>The <i>peyotl</i> was not the only herb prized as a means of casting the soul
into the condition of hypostatic union with divinity. We have abundant
evidence that long after the conquest the seeds of the plant called in
Nahuatl the <i>ololiuhqui</i> were in high<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span> esteem for this purpose. In the
Confessionary of Father Bartholom&eacute; de Alva the priest is supposed to
inquire and learn as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;<i>Question.</i> Hast thou loved God above all things? Hast thou loved
any created thing, adoring it, looking upon it as God, and
worshiping it?</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Answer.</i> I have loved God with all my heart; but sometimes I have
believed in dreams, and also I have believed in the sacred herbs,
the <i>peyotl</i>, and the <i>ololiuhqui</i>; and in other such things
(<i>onicneltocac in temictli, in xiuhtzintli, in peyotl, in
ololiuhqui, yhuan in occequitlamantli</i>).&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_8-1_12" id="FNanchor_8-1_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_8-1_12" class="fnanchor">8-*</a></p></div>

<p>The seeds of the <i>ololiuhqui</i> appear to have been employed externally.
They were the efficient element in the mysterious unguent known as &#8220;the
divine remedy&#8221; (<i>teopatli</i>), about which we find some information in the
works of Father Augustin de Vetancurt, who lived in Mexico in the middle
of the seventeenth century. He writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The pagan priests made use of an ointment composed of insects,
such as spiders, scorpions, centipedes and the like, which the
neophytes in the temples prepared. They burned these insects in a
basin, collected the ashes, and rubbed it up with green tobacco
leaves, living worms and insects, and the powdered seeds of a plant
called <i>ololiuhqui</i>, which has the power of inducing visions, and
the effect of which is to destroy the reasoning powers. Under the
influence of this ointment, they conversed with the Devil, and he
with them, practicing his deceptions upon them. They also believed
that it protected them, so they had no fear of going into the woods
at night.</p>

<p>&#8220;This was also employed by them as a remedy in various diseases,
and the soothing influence of the tobacco and the <i>ololiuhqui</i> was
attributed by them to divine agency. There are some in our own day
who make use of this ointment for sorcery, shutting themselves up,
and losing their reason under its influence; especially some old
men and old women, who are prepared to fall an easy prey to the
Devil.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_8-2_13" id="FNanchor_8-2_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_8-2_13" class="fnanchor">8-&#8224;</a></p></div>

<p>The botanist Hernandez observes that another name for this plant was
<i>coaxihuitl</i>, &#8220;serpent plant,&#8221; and adds that its seeds contain a
narcotic poison, and that it is allied to the genus <i>Solanum</i>, of which
the deadly night-shade is a familiar species. He speaks of its use in
the sacred rites in these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Indorum sacrifici, cum videri volebant versari cum superis, ac
responsa accipere ab eis, ea vescebantur planta, ut desiperent,
milleque phantasmata et demonum observatium effigies
circumspectarent.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_8-3_14" id="FNanchor_8-3_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_8-3_14" class="fnanchor">8-&#8225;</a></p></div>

<p>Of the two plants mentioned, the <i>ololiuhqui</i> and the <i>peyotl</i>, the
former was considered the more potent in spiritual virtues. &#8220;They hold
it in as much veneration as if it were God,&#8221; says a theologian of the
seventeenth century.<a name="FNanchor_9-1_15" id="FNanchor_9-1_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_9-1_15" class="fnanchor">9-*</a> One who partook of these herbs was called
<i>payni</i> (from the verb <i>pay</i>, to take medicine); and more especially
<i>tlachixqui</i>, a Seer, referring to the mystic &#8220;second sight,&#8221; hence a
diviner or prophet (from the verb <i>tlachia</i>, to see).</p>

<p>Tobacco also held a prominent, though less important, place in these
rites. It was employed in two forms, the one the dried leaf, <i>picietl</i>,
which for sacred uses must be broken and rubbed up either seven or nine
times; and the green leaf mixed with lime, hence called <i>tenextlecietl</i>
(from <i>tenextli</i>, lime).</p>

<p>Allied in effect to these is an intoxicant in use in southern Mexico and
Yucatan, prepared from the bark of a tree called by the Mayas
<i>baal-che</i>. The whites speak of the drink as <i>pitarilla</i>. It is quite
popular among the natives, and they still attribute to it a sacred
character, calling it <i>yax ha</i>, the first water, the primal fluid. They
say that it was the first liquid created by God, and when He returned to
His heavenly home He left this beverage and its production in charge of
the gods of the rains, the four Pah-Ahtuns.<a name="FNanchor_9-2_16" id="FNanchor_9-2_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_9-2_16" class="fnanchor">9-&#8224;</a></p>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_5" id="section_5"></a><b>5.</b> Intoxication of some kind was an essential part of many of these
secret rites. It was regarded as a method of throwing the individual out
of himself and into relation with the supernal powers. What the old
historian, Father Joseph de Acosta, tells us about the clairvoyants and
telepaths of the aborigines might well stand for a description of their
modern representatives:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Some of these sorcerers take any shape they choose, and fly
through the air with wonderful rapidity and for long distances.
They will tell what is taking place in remote localities long
before the news could possibly arrive. The Spaniards have known
them to report mutinies, battles, revolts and deaths, occurring two
hundred or three hundred leagues distant, on the very day they took
place, or the day after.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum' style="font-size: 89%;"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>&#8220;To practice this art the sorcerers, usually old women, shut
themselves in a house, and intoxicate themselves to the degree of
losing their reason. The next day they are ready to reply to
questions.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_10-1_17" id="FNanchor_10-1_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_10-1_17" class="fnanchor">10-*</a></p></div>

<p>Plants possessing similar powers to excite vivid visions and distort the
imagination, and, therefore, employed in the magical rites, were the
<i>thiuimeezque</i>, in Michoacan, and the <i>chacuaco</i>, in lower
California.<a name="FNanchor_10-2_18" id="FNanchor_10-2_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_10-2_18" class="fnanchor">10-&#8224;</a></p>

continued to thrive in Mexico. We find in a book of sermons published by
the Jesuit Father, Ignacio de Paredes, in the Nahuatl language, in 1757,
that he strenuously warns his hearers against invoking, consulting, or
calling upon &#8220;the devilish spell-binders, the nagualists, and those who
conjure with smoke.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_10-3_19" id="FNanchor_10-3_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_10-3_19" class="fnanchor">10-&#8225;</a></p>

<p>They have not yet lost their power; we have evidence enough that many
children of a larger growth in that land still listen with respect to
the recitals of the mysterious faculties attributed to the
<i>nanahualtin</i>. An observant German traveler, Carlos von Gagern, informs
us that they are widely believed to be able to cause sicknesses and
other ills, which must be counteracted by appropriate exorcisms, among
which the reading aloud certain passages of the Bible is deemed to be
one of the most potent.<a name="FNanchor_10-4_20" id="FNanchor_10-4_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_10-4_20" class="fnanchor">10-&sect;</a></p>

<p>The learned historian, Orozco y Berra, speaks of the powers attributed
at the present day to the <i>nahual</i> in Mexico among the lower classes, in
these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The <i>nahual</i> is generally an old Indian with red eyes, who knows
how to turn himself into a dog, woolly, black and ugly. The female
witch can convert herself into a ball of fire; she has the power of
flight, and at night will enter the windows and suck the blood of
little children. These sorcerers will make little images of rags or
of clay, then stick into them the thorn of the maguey and place
them in some secret place; you can<span class='pagenum' style="font-size: 89%;"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> be sure that the person against
whom the conjuration is practiced will feel pain in the part where
the thorn is inserted. There still exist among them the
medicine-men, who treat the sick by means of strange contortions,
call upon the spirits, pronounce magical incantations, blow upon
the part where the pain is, and draw forth from the patient thorns,
worms, or pieces of stone. They know how to prepare drinks which
will bring on sickness, and if the patients are cured by others the
convalescents are particular to throw something of their own away,
as a lock of hair, or a part of their clothing. Those who possess
the evil eye can, by merely looking at children, deprive them of
beauty and health, and even cause their death.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_11-1_21" id="FNanchor_11-1_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_11-1_21" class="fnanchor">11-*</a></p></div>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_7" id="section_7"></a><b>7.</b> As I have said, nowhere in the records of purely Mexican, that is,
Aztecan, Nagualism do we find the word <i>nagual</i> employed in the sense
given in the passage quoted from Herrera, that is as a personal guardian
spirit or tutelary genius. These tribes had, indeed, a belief in some
such protecting power, and held that it was connected with the day on
which each person is born. They called it the <i>tonalli</i> of a person, a
word translated to mean that which is peculiar to him, which makes his
individuality, his self. The radical from which it is derived is <i>tona</i>,
to warm, or to be warm, from which are also derived <i>tonatiuh</i>, the sun.
<i>Tonalli</i>, which in composition loses its last syllable, is likewise the
word for heat, summer, soul, spirit and day, and also for the share or
portion which belongs to one. Thus, <i>to-tonal</i> is spirit or soul in
general; <i>no-tonal</i>, my spirit; <i>no-tonal in ipan no-tlacat</i>, &#8220;the sign
under which I was born,&#8221; <i>i. e.</i>, the astrological day-sign. From this
came the verb <i>tonalpoa</i>, to count or estimate the signs, that is, to
cast the horoscope of a person; and <i>tonalpouhque</i>, the diviners whose
business it was to practice this art.<a name="FNanchor_11-2_22" id="FNanchor_11-2_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_11-2_22" class="fnanchor">11-&#8224;</a></p>

<p>These <i>tonalpouhque</i> are referred to at length by Father
Sahagun.<a name="FNanchor_11-3_23" id="FNanchor_11-3_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_11-3_23" class="fnanchor">11-&#8225;</a> He distinguishes them from the <i>naualli</i>, though it is
clear that they corresponded in functions to the nagualistic priests of
the southern tribes. From the number and name of the day of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> birth they
forecast the destiny of the child, and stated the power or spiritual
influence which should govern its career.</p>

<p>The <i>tonal</i> was by no means an indefeasible possession. It was a sort of
independent <i>mascotte</i>. So long as it remained with a person he enjoyed
health and prosperity; but it could depart, go astray, become lost; and
then sickness and misfortune arrived. This is signified in the Nahuatl
language by the verbs <i>tonalcaualtia</i>, to check, stop or suspend the
<i>tonal</i>, hence, to shock or frighten one; and <i>tonalitlacoa</i>, to hurt or
injure the <i>tonal</i>, hence, to cast a spell on one, to bewitch him.</p>

<p>This explains the real purpose of the conjuring and incantations which
were carried on by the native doctor when visiting the sick. It was to
recall the <i>tonal</i>, to force or persuade it to return; and, therefore,
the ceremony bore the name &#8220;the restitution of the <i>tonal</i>,&#8221; and was
more than any other deeply imbued with the superstitions of Nagualism.
The chief officiant was called the <i>tetonaltiani</i>, &#8220;he who concerns
himself with the tonal.&#8221; On a later page I shall give the formula
recited on such an occasion.</p>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_8" id="section_8"></a><b>8.</b> There is some vague mention in the Aztec records of a semi-priestly
order, who bore the name <i>naualteteuctin</i>, which may be translated
&#8220;master magicians.&#8221; They were also known as <i>teotlauice</i>, &#8220;sacred
companions in arms.&#8221; As was the case with most classes of the
<i>teteuctin</i>, or nobles, entrance to the order was by a severe and
prolonged ceremony of initiation, the object of which was not merely to
test the endurance of pain and the powers of self-denial, but especially
to throw the mind into that subjective state in which it is brought into
contact with the divine, in which it can &#8220;see visions and dream dreams.&#8221;
The order claimed as its patron and founder Quetzalcoatl, the &#8220;feathered
serpent,&#8221; who, it will be seen on another page, was also the patron of
the later nagualists.<a name="FNanchor_12-1_24" id="FNanchor_12-1_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_12-1_24" class="fnanchor">12-*</a></p>

<p>The word <i>naualli</i> also occurs among the ancient Nahuas in composition
as a part of proper names; always with the signification of &#8220;magician,&#8221;
as in that of Naualcuauhtla, a chief of the Chalcos, meaning
&#8220;wizard-stick,&#8221; referring probably to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> rod or wand employed by the
magi in conjuration.<a name="FNanchor_13-1_25" id="FNanchor_13-1_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_13-1_25" class="fnanchor">13-*</a> So also <i>Naualac</i>, the &#8220;wizard water,&#8221; an
artificial lake not far from the city of Mexico, surrounded by ruined
temples, described by M. Charnay.<a name="FNanchor_13-2_26" id="FNanchor_13-2_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_13-2_26" class="fnanchor">13-&#8224;</a></p>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_9" id="section_9"></a><b>9.</b> The belief in a personal guardian spirit was one of the fundamental
doctrines of Nagualism; but this belief by no means connotes the full
import of the term (as Mr. H. H. Bancroft has erroneously stated). The
calendar system of Mexico and Central America, which I have shown to be
substantially the same throughout many diverse linguistic
stocks,<a name="FNanchor_13-3_27" id="FNanchor_13-3_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_13-3_27" class="fnanchor">13-&#8225;</a> had as one of its main objects, astrological
divination. By consulting it the appropriate nagual was discovered and
assigned, and this was certainly a prominent feature in the native cult
and has never been abandoned.</p>

<p>In Mexico to-day, in addition to his special personal guardian, the
native will often choose another for a limited time or for a particular
purpose, and this is quite consistent with the form of Christianity he
has been taught. For instance, as we are informed by an observant
traveler, at New Year or at corn-planting the head of a family will go
to the parish church and among the various saints there displayed will
select one as his guardian for the year. He will address to him his
prayers for rain and sunshine, for an abundant harvest, health and
prosperity, and will not neglect to back these supplications by liberal
gifts. If times are good and harvests ample the Santo is rewarded with
still more gifts, and his aid is sought for another term; but if luck
has been bad the Indian repairs to the church at the end of the year,
bestows on his holy patron a sound cursing, calls him all the bad names
he can think of, and has nothing more to do with him.<a name="FNanchor_13-4_28" id="FNanchor_13-4_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_13-4_28" class="fnanchor">13-&sect;</a></p>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_10" id="section_10"></a><b>10.</b> A Mexican writer, Andres Iglesias, who enjoyed more than common
opportunities to study these practices as they exist in the present
generation, describes them as he saw them in the village of Soteapan, a
remote hamlet in the State of Vera Cruz, the population of which speak
the Mixe language. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> is not related to the Nahuatl tongue, but the
terms of their magical rites are drawn from Nahuatl words, showing their
origin. Every person at birth has assigned to him both a good and a bad
genius, the former aiming at his welfare, the latter at his injury. The
good genius is known by the Nahuatl term <i>tonale</i>, and it is represented
in the first bird or animal of any kind which is seen in or near the
house immediately after the birth of the infant.</p>

<p>The most powerful person in the village is the high priest of the native
cult. One who died about 1850 was called &#8220;the Thunderbolt,&#8221; and whenever
he walked abroad he was preceded by a group of chosen disciples, called
by the Nahuatl name <i>tlatoques</i>, speakers or attorneys.<a name="FNanchor_14-1_29" id="FNanchor_14-1_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_14-1_29" class="fnanchor">14-*</a> His

to the stocks, but did not interfere with the regular payment of tribute
to him by the villagers. He was also a medicine man and master of
ceremonies in certain &#8220;scandalous orgies, where immodesty shows herself
without a veil.&#8221;<a name="corr1" title="corr1"></a><a name="FNanchor_14-2_30" id="FNanchor_14-2_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_14-2_30" class="fnanchor"><ins class="correction" title="inserted based on context">14-&#8224;</ins></a></p>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_11" id="section_11"></a><b>11.</b> Turning to the neighboring province of Oaxaca and its inhabitants,
we are instructed on the astrological use of the calendar of the
Zapotecs by Father Juan de Cordova, whose <i>Arte</i> of their language was
published at Mexico in 1578. From what he says its principal, if not its
only purpose, was astrological. Each day had its number and was called
after some animal, as eagle, snake, deer, rabbit, etc. Every child, male
or female, received the name of the day, and also its number, as a
surname; its personal name being taken from a fixed series, which
differed in the masculine and feminine gender, and which seems to have
been derived from the names of the fingers.</p>

<p>From this it appears that among the Zapotecs the personal spirit or
<i>nagual</i> was fixed by the date of the birth, and not by some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span> later
ceremony, although the latter has been asserted by some writers; who,
however, seem to have applied without certain knowledge the rites of the
Nahuas and other surrounding tribes to the Zapotecs.<a name="FNanchor_15-1_31" id="FNanchor_15-1_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_15-1_31" class="fnanchor">15-*</a></p>

<p>Next in importance to the assigning of names, according to Father
Cordova, was the employment of the calendar in deciding the propriety of
marriages. As the recognized object of marriage was to have sons, the
couple appealed to the professional augur to decide this question before
the marriage was fixed. He selected as many beans as was the sum of the
numbers of the two proponents&#8217; names, and, counting them by twos, if one
remained over, it meant a son; then counting by threes any remainder
also meant sons; by fours the remainder meant either sons or daughters;
and by five and six the same; and if there was no remainder by any of
these five divisors the marriage would result in no sons and was
prohibited.</p>

<p>It is obvious that this method of fortune-telling was most auspicious
for the lovers; for I doubt if there is any combination of two numbers
below fourteen which is divisible by two, three, four, five and six
without remainder in any one instance.<a name="FNanchor_15-2_32" id="FNanchor_15-2_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_15-2_32" class="fnanchor">15-&#8224;</a></p>

<p>The Zapotecs were one of those nations who voluntarily submitted
themselves to the Spaniards, not out of love for the Europeans, but
through hatred of the Aztecs, who had conquered them in the preceding
century. Their king, Coyopy, and his subjects accepted Christianity and
were generally baptized; but it was the merest formality, and years
afterwards Coyopy was detected secretly conducting the heathen ritual of
his ancestors with all due pomp. He was arrested, sent to the city of
Mexico, deprived of his power and wealth, and soon died; it is
charitably supposed, from natural causes. There is no question but that
he left successors to the office of pontifex maximus, and that they
continued the native religious ceremonies.</p>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_12" id="section_12"></a><b>12.</b> The sparse notices we have of the astrology of the Mixtecs,
neighbors and some think relatives of the Zapotecs, reveal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span> closely
similar rites. The name of their king, who opposed Montezuma the First
some sixty years before the arrival of Cortez, proves that they made use
of the same or a similar calendar in bestowing personal appellations. It
is given as <i>Tres Micos</i>, Three Monkeys.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, so far as I know, there has not been published, and
perhaps there does not exist, an authentic copy of the Mixtec calendar.
It was nevertheless reduced to writing in the native tongue after the
conquest, and a copy of it was seen by the historian Burgoa in the
Mixtec town of Yanhuitlan.<a name="FNanchor_16-1_33" id="FNanchor_16-1_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_16-1_33" class="fnanchor">16-*</a> Each day was named from a tree, a plant
or an animal, and from them the individual received his names, as Four
Lions, Five Roses, etc. (examples given by Herrera). This latter writer
adds that the name was assigned by the priests when the child was seven
years old (as among the Tzentals), part of the rite being to conduct it
to the temple and bore its ears. He refers also to their auguries
relating to marriage.<a name="FNanchor_16-2_34" id="FNanchor_16-2_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_16-2_34" class="fnanchor">16-&#8224;</a> These appear to have been different from
among the Zapotecs. It was necessary that the youth should have a name
bearing a higher number than that of the maiden, and also &#8220;that they
should be related;&#8221; probably this applied only to certain formal
marriages of the rulers which were obliged to be within the same <i>gens</i>.</p>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_13" id="section_13"></a><b>13.</b> I have referred in some detail to the rites and superstitions
connected with the Calendar because they are all essential parts of
Nagualism, carried on far into Christian times by the priests of this
secret cult, as was fully recognized by the Catholic clergy. Wherever
this calendar was in use, the Freemasonry of Nagualism extended, and its
ritual had constant reference to it. Our fullest information about it
does not come from central Mexico, but further south, in the region
occupied by the various branches of the Mayan stock, by the ancestors of
some one of which, perhaps, this singular calendar, and the symbolism
connected with it, were invented.</p>

<p>One of the most important older authorities on this subject is Francisco
Nu&ntilde;ez de la Vega, a learned Dominican, who was appointed Bishop of
Chiapas and Soconusco in 1687, and who published at Rome, in 1702, a
stately folio entitled &#8220;<i>Constitu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>ciones Di&#339;cesanas del Obispado de
Chiappa</i>,&#8221; comprising discussions of the articles of religion and a
series of pastoral letters. The subject of Nagualism is referred to in
many passages, and the ninth Pastoral Letter is devoted to it. As this
book is one of extreme rarity, I shall make rather lengthy extracts from
it, taking the liberty of condensing the scholastic prolixity of the
author, and omitting his professional admonitions to the wicked.</p>

<p>He begins his references to it in several passages of his Introduction
or <i>Preambulo</i>, in which he makes some interesting statements as to the
use to which the natives put their newly-acquired knowledge of writing,
while at the same time they had evidently not forgotten the ancient
method of recording ideas invented by their ancestors.</p>

<p>The Bishop writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The Indians of New Spain retain all the errors of their time of
heathenism preserved in certain writings in their own languages,
explaining by abbreviated characters and by figures painted in a
secret cypher<a name="FNanchor_17-1_35" id="FNanchor_17-1_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_17-1_35" class="fnanchor">17-*</a> the places, provinces and names of their early
rulers, the animals, stars and elements which they worshiped, the
ceremonies and sacrifices which they observed, and the years,
months and days by which they predicted the fortunes of children at
birth, and assign them that which they call the Naguals. These
writings are known as Repertories or Calendars, and they are also
used to discover articles lost or stolen, and to effect cures of
diseases. Some have a wheel painted in them, like that of
Pythagoras, described by the Venerable Bede; others portray a lake
surrounded by the Naguals in the form of various animals. Some of
the Nagualist Masters claim as their patron and ruler Cuchulchan,
and they possessed a certain formula of prayer to him, written in
the Popoluca tongue (which was called Baha in their time of
heathenism), and which has been translated into Mexican.<a name="FNanchor_17-2_36" id="FNanchor_17-2_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_17-2_36" class="fnanchor">17-&#8224;</a></p>

<p>&#8220;Those who are selected to become the masters of these arts are
taught from early childhood how to draw and paint these characters,
and are obliged to learn by heart the formulas, and the names of
the ancient Nagualists, and whatever else is included in these
written documents, many of which we have held in our hands, and
have heard them explained by such masters whom we had imprisoned
for their guilt, and who had afterwards become converted and
acknowledged their sins.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_17-3_37" id="FNanchor_17-3_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_17-3_37" class="fnanchor">17-&#8225;</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>The Bishop made up his mind that extreme measures should be taken to
eradicate these survivals of the ancient paganism in his diocese, and he
therefore promulgated the following order in the year 1692:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;And because in the provinces of our diocese those Indians who are
Nagualists adore their <i>naguals</i>, and look upon them as gods, and
by their aid believe that they can foretell the future, discover
hidden treasures, and fulfill their dishonest desires: we,
therefore, prescribe and command that in every town an
ecclesiastical prison shall be constructed at the expense of the
church, and that it be provided with fetters and stocks (con
grillos y cepos), and we confer authority on every priest and
curate of a parish to imprison in these gaols whoever is guilty of
disrespect toward our Holy Faith, and we enjoin them to treat with
especial severity those who teach the doctrines of Nagualism (y con
rigor mayor &aacute; los dogmatizantes Nagualistas).&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_18-1_38" id="FNanchor_18-1_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_18-1_38" class="fnanchor">18-*</a></p></div>

<p>In spite of these injunctions it is evident that he failed to destroy
the seeds of what he esteemed this dangerous heresy in the parishes of
his diocese; for his ninth Pastoral Letter, in which he exposes at
length the character of Nagualism, is dated from the metropolitan city
of Ciudad Real, on May 24, 1698. As much of it is germane to my theme, I
translate as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;There are certain bad Christians of both sexes who do not hesitate
to follow the school of the Devil, and to occupy themselves with
evil arts, divinations, sorceries, conjuring, enchantments,
fortune-telling, and other means to forecast the future.</p>

<p>&#8220;These are those who in all the provinces of New Spain are known by
the name of <i>Nagualists</i>. They pretend that the birth of men is
regulated by the course and movements of stars and planets, and by
observing the time of day and the months in which a child is born,
they prognosticate its condition and the events, prosperous or
otherwise, of its life; and the worst is that these perverse men
have written down their signs and rules, and thus deceive the
erring and ignorant.</p>

<p>&#8220;These Nagualists practice their arts by means of Repertories and
superstitious Calendars, where are represented under their proper
names all the Naguals of stars, elements, birds, fishes, brute
beasts and dumb animals; with a vain note of days and months, so
that they can announce which corresponds to the day of birth of the
infant. This is preceded by some diabolical ceremonies, after which
they designate the field or other spot, where, after seven years
shall have elapsed, the Nagual will appear to ratify the bargain.
As the time approaches, they instruct the child to<span class='pagenum' style="font-size: 89%;"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span> deny God and
His Blessed Mother, and warn him to have no fear, and not to make
the sign of the cross. He is told to embrace his Nagual tenderly,
which, by some diabolical art, presents itself in an affectionate
manner even though it be a ferocious beast, like a lion or a tiger.
Thus, with infernal cunning they persuade him that this Nagual is
an angel of God, who will look after him and protect him in his
after life.</p>

<p>&#8220;To such diabolical masters the intelligent Indians apply, to learn
from these superstitious Calendars, dictated by the Devil, their
own fortunes, and the Naguals which will be assigned to their
children, even before they are baptized. In most of the Calendars,
the seventh sign is the figure of a man and a snake, which they
call Cuchulchan. The masters have explained it as a snake with
feathers which moves in the water. This sign corresponds with
Mexzichuaut, which means Cloudy Serpent, or, of the clouds.<a name="FNanchor_19-1_39" id="FNanchor_19-1_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_19-1_39" class="fnanchor">19-*</a>
The people also consult them in order to work injury on their
enemies, taking the lives of many through such devilish artifices,
and committing unspeakable atrocities.</p>

<p>&#8220;Worse even than these are those who wander about as physicians or
healers; who are none such, but magicians, enchanters, and
sorcerers, who, while pretending to cure, kill whom they will. They
apply their medicines by blowing on the patient, and by the use of
infernal words; learned by heart by those who cannot read or write;
and received in writing from their masters by those acquainted with
letters. The Master never imparts this instruction to a single
disciple, but always to three at a time, so that in the practice of
the art it may be difficult to decide which one exerts the magical
power. They blow on feathers, or sticks, or plants, and place them
in the paths where they may be stepped on by those they wish to
injure, thus causing chills, fevers, ugly pustules and other
diseases; or they introduce into the body by such arts toads,
frogs, snakes, centipedes, <a name="corr2" title="corr2"></a><ins class="correction" title="etc.,">etc,</ins> causing great torments. And
by these same breathings and magic words they can burn down houses,
destroy the growing crops and induce sickness. No one of the three
disciples is permitted to practice any of these arts without
previously informing the other two, and also the Master, by whom
the three have been taught.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have learned by the confession of certain guilty parties how
the Master begins to instruct his disciple. First he tells him to
abjure God, the saints and the Virgin, not to invoke their names,
and to have no fear of them. He then conducts him to the wood,
glen, cave or field where the pact with the Devil is concluded,
which they call &#8216;the agreement&#8217; or &#8216;the word given&#8217; (in Tzental
<i>quiz</i>). In some provinces the disciple is laid on an ant-hill, and
the Master standing above him calls forth a snake, colored with
black, white and red, which is known as &#8216;the ant-mother&#8217; (in
Tzental <i>zmezquiz</i>).<a name="FNanchor_19-2_40" id="FNanchor_19-2_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_19-2_40" class="fnanchor">19-&#8224;</a> This comes accompanied by the ants<span class='pagenum' style="font-size: 89%;"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and other small snakes of the same kind, which enter at the joints
of the fingers, beginning with the left hand, and coming out at the
joints of the right hand, and also by the ears and the nose; while
the great snake enters the body with a leap and emerges at its
posterior vent. Afterwards the disciple meets a dragon vomiting
fire, which swallows him entire and ejects him posteriorly. Then
the Master declares he may be admitted, and asks him to select the
herbs with which he will conjure, the disciple names them, the
Master gathers them and delivers them to him, and then teaches him
the sacred words.</p>

<p>&#8220;These words and ceremonies are substantially the same in all the
provinces. The healer enters the house of the invalid, asks about
the sickness, lays his hand on the suffering part, and then leaves,
promising to return on the day following. At the next visit he
brings with him some herbs which he chews or mashes with a little
water and applies to the part. Then he repeats the <i>Pater Noster</i>,
the <i>Ave</i>, the <i>Credo</i> and the <i>Salve</i> and blows upon the seat of
disease, afterwards pronouncing the magical words taught him by his
master. He continues blowing in this manner, inhaling and exhaling,
repeating under his breath these magical expressions, which are
powerful to kill or to cure as he chooses, through the compact he
has made with the Devil. Finally, so as to deceive the bystanders,
he ends with saying in a loud voice: &#8216;God the Father, God the Son,
and God the Holy Ghost. Amen.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;This physician or healer is called in the towns of some of the
provinces <i>poxta vanegs</i>, and the medicine <i>gspoxil</i>; and
everything relating to healing among the Indians to which they
apply these terms means also to practice sorcery; and all words
derived from <i>pox</i> allude to the Nagual; for this in some provinces
is called <i>poxlon</i>, and in others <i>patzlan</i>, and in many
<i>tzihuizin</i>, which is something very much feared by the Indians. We
have ascertained by the confessions of many who have been
reconciled that the Devil at times appears to them in the shape of
a ball or globe of fire in the air, with a tail like a comet.<a name="FNanchor_20-1_41" id="FNanchor_20-1_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_20-1_41" class="fnanchor">20-*</a></p>

<p>&#8220;According to the most ancient traditions of these Indians this
idol, <i>poxlon</i>, was one of the most important and venerated they
had in the old<span class='pagenum' style="font-size: 89%;"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span> times, and the Tzentals revered it so much that
they preserved it innumerable years painted on a tablet in the
above figure. Even after they were converted to the faith, they
hung it behind a beam in the church of the town of Oxchuc,
accompanied by an image of their god Hicalahau, having a ferocious
black face with the members of a man,<a name="FNanchor_21-1_42" id="FNanchor_21-1_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_21-1_42" class="fnanchor">21-*</a> along with five owls
and vultures. By divine interposition, we discovered these on our
second visit there in 1687, and had no little difficulty in getting
them down, we reciting the creed, and the Indians constantly
spitting as they executed our orders. These objects were publicly
burned in the plaza.</p>

<p>&#8220;In other parts they reverence the bones of the earlier Nagualists,
preserving them in caves, where they adorn them with flowers and
burn copal before them. We have discovered some of these and burned
them, hoping to root out and put a stop to such evil ceremonies of
the infernal sect of the Nagualists.</p>

<p>&#8220;At present, all are not so subject to the promptings of the Devil
as formerly, but there are still some so closely allied to him that
they transform themselves into tigers, lions, bulls, flashes of
light and globes of fire. We can say from the declaration and
solemn confession of some penitents that it is proved that the
Devil had carnal relations with them, both as incubus and succubus,
approaching them in the form of their Nagual; and there was one
woman who remained in the forest a week with the demon in the form
of her Nagual, acting toward him as does an infatuated woman toward
her lover (como pudiera con su proprio amigo una muger amancebada).
As a punishment for such horrible crimes our Lord has permitted
that they lose their life as soon as their Nagual is killed; and
that they bear on their own bodies the wound or mark of the blow
which killed it; as the curas of Chamula, Copainala and other
places have assured us.</p>

<p>&#8220;The devilish seed of this Nagualism has rooted itself in the very
flesh and blood of these Indians. It perseveres in their hearts
through the instructions of the masters of the sect, and there is
scarcely a town in these provinces in which it has not been
introduced. It is a superstitious idolatry, full of monstrous
incests, sodomies and detestable bestialities.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Such are the words of the Bishop of Chiapas. We learn from his
thoroughly instructed and unimpeachable testimony that at the beginning
of the eighteenth century Nagualism was a widespread and active
institution among the Indians of southern Mexico; that it was taught and
practiced by professors who were so much feared and respected that, as
he tells us in another passage, they were called &#8220;masters of the
towns;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_21-2_43" id="FNanchor_21-2_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_21-2_43" class="fnanchor">21-&#8224;</a> that they gave systematic instruction to disciples in
classes of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span> three, all of whom were bound together by pledges of mutual
information and assistance; that a fundamental principle of the
organization and an indispensable step in the initiation into its
mysteries was the abjuration of the Christian religion, and an undying
hatred to its teachers and all others of the race of the white
oppressors; and that when they made use of Christian phrases or
ceremonies it was either in derision or out of hypocrisy, the better to
conceal their real sentiments.</p>

<p>There are a number of other witnesses from the seventeenth century that
may be summoned to strengthen this testimony, if it needs it.</p>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_14" id="section_14"></a><b>14.</b> In the <i>History of Guatemala</i>, written about 1690 by Francisco
Antonio Fuentes y Guzman, the author gives some information about a
sorcerer of this school, who was arrested in Totonicapan, and with whom
the historian had something to do as <i>corregidor</i>.</p>

<p>The redoubtable magician was a little old man, <i>viejezuelo</i>, and when
caught had in his possession a document giving the days of the year
according to the European calendar, with the Nagual, which belonged to
each one. That for January is alone given by our writer, but it is
probable that the other months merely repeated the naguals corresponding
to the numbers. It ran as follows:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>When the sorcerer was examined as to the manner of assigning the proper
nagual to a child he gave the following account:</p>

<p>Having been informed of its day of birth, he in due time called at the
residence of the parents, and told the mother to bring the child into
the field behind the house. Having there invoked the demon, the <i>nagual</i>
of the child would appear under the form of the animal or object set
opposite its birthday in the calendar, a serpent were it born on the 2d
of January, a flower were it on the 13th, fire were it on the 24th, and
so on. The sorcerer then addressed certain prayers to the <i>nagual</i> to
protect the little one, and told the mother to take it daily to the same
spot, where its <i>nagual</i> would appear to it, and would finally accompany
it through all its life. Some, but not all, obtained the power of
transforming themselves into the <i>nagual</i>, and the author declares that,
though he could not cite such a case from his own experience, his father
knew of several, and reliable priests, <i>religiosos de f&eacute;</i>, had told him
enough examples to fill volumes.<a name="FNanchor_23-1_44" id="FNanchor_23-1_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_23-1_44" class="fnanchor">23-*</a></p>

<p>The tribes to which this author refers were the Cakchiquels and Quiches,
who spoke practically the same tongue. An examination of some of the old
dictionaries prepared by the early missionaries furnishes further and
interesting information about this obscure subject.</p>

<p>In the Cakchiquel language of Guatemala, the word <i>naual</i> was applied
both to the magician himself, to his necromantic art, and to the demonic
agency which taught and protected him. This is shown by the following
explanation, which I quote from Father Coto&#8217;s <i>Vocabulario de la Lengua
Cakchiquel</i>, 1651, a manuscript in the library of the American
Philosophical Society:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;<i>Magic</i> or <i>Necromancy</i>: <i>puz</i> or <i>naual</i>; and they were
accustomed to call their magicians or sorcerers by the same terms.
It was a kind of magic which they invoked in order to transform
themselves into eagles, lions, tigers, etc. Thus, they said, <i>ru
puz</i>, <i>ru naual</i>, <i>pedro l&aelig; cot</i>, <i>balam</i>, &#8216;Peter&#8217;s power, his
<i>naual</i>, is a lion, a tiger.&#8217; They also applied the words <i>puz</i> and
<i>naual</i> to certain trees, rocks and other inanimate objects, whence
the Devil used to speak to them, and likewise to the idols which
they worshiped, as <i>gazlic che</i>, <i>gazlic abah</i>, <i>huyu</i>, <i>k&#8217;o ru
naual</i>, &#8216;The life of the tree, the life of the stone, of the hill,
is its <i>naual</i>,&#8217; etc.; because they believed there was life in
these objects. They used to have armies and<span class='pagenum' style="font-size: 89%;"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span> soldiery to guard
their lands, and the captains, as well as many who were not
captains, had their <i>nauales</i>. They called the captain <i>ru g&#8217;
alache; rohobachi, ti ru gaah, ru pocob, ru gh&#8217; amay a ghay ti be
chi naualil</i> [he works magic with his shield, his lance, and his
arrows].</p>

<p>&#8220;To practice such magical arts: <i>tin naualih</i> (&#8216;I practice magic&#8217;),
an active verb. They use it, for instance, when a man asks his wife
for something to eat or drink, and she has nothing, owing to his
negligence, she will say: &#8216;Where do you suppose I can get what you
want? Do you expect me to perform miracles&mdash;<i>xa pe ri tin
naualih</i>&mdash;that they shall come to my hands?&#8217; So when one is asked
to lend or give something which he has not, he will exclaim: <i>Tin
naualih pe ri puvak</i>, etc. (&#8216;Can I perform miracles,&#8217; etc.)</p>

<p>&#8220;It also signifies to pretend something, concealing the truth, as
<i>xa ru naualim ara neh chu g&#8217; ux ri tzih tan tu bijh pedro</i>, &#8216;Peter
is feigning this which he is saying.&#8217; They are also accustomed to
apply this word to the power which the priests exert (in the
sacraments, etc.).&#8221;</p></div>

<p>A long and foolish account of the witchcraft supposed to be practiced
among the Pokonchis of Guatemala, also a tribe of Mayan stock, is given
by the Englishman, Thomas Gage, who was cura of a parish among them
about 1630, and afterwards returned to England and Protestantism. He
described, at wearisome length, the supposed metamorphosis of two chiefs
of neighboring tribes, the one into a lion, the other into a tiger, and
the mortal combat in which they engaged, resulting in the death of one
to whom Gage administered absolution. No doubt he had been worsted in a
personal encounter with his old enemy, and, being a man of eighty years,
had not the vigor to recover. The account is of interest only as proving
that the same superstitions at that time prevailed among the Pokonchis
as in other portions of Guatemala.<a name="FNanchor_24-1_45" id="FNanchor_24-1_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_24-1_45" class="fnanchor">24-*</a></p>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_15" id="section_15"></a><b>15.</b> A really mighty nagualist was not confined to a single
transformation. He could take on many and varied figures. One such is
described in the sacred books of the Quiches of Guatemala, that document
known by the name of the Popol Vuh, or National Book. The passage is in
reference to one of their great kings and powerful magicians, Gucumatz
by name. It says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Truly he was a wonderful king. Every seven days he ascended to the
sky, and every seven days he followed the path to the abode of the<span class='pagenum' style="font-size: 89%;"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
dead; every seven days he put on the nature of a serpent, and then
he became truly a serpent; every seven days he assumed the nature
of an eagle, and then he became truly an eagle; then of a tiger and
he became truly a tiger; then of coagulated blood, and he was
nothing else than coagulated blood.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_25-1_46" id="FNanchor_25-1_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_25-1_46" class="fnanchor">25-*</a></p></div>

<p>It may be said that such passages refer metaphorically to the
versatility of his character, but even if this is so, the metaphors are
drawn from the universal belief in Nagualism which then prevailed, and
they do not express it too strongly.</p>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_16" id="section_16"></a><b>16.</b> Among the Maya tribes of Yucatan and Guatemala we have testimony to
the continuance to this day of these beliefs. Father Bartolom&eacute; de Baeza,
cura of Yaxcaba in the first half of this century, reports that an old
man, in his dying confession, declared that by diabolical art he had
transformed himself into an animal, doubtless his <i>nagual</i>; and a young
girl of some twelve years confessed that she had been transformed into a
bird by the witches, and in one of her nocturnal flights had rested on
the roof of the very house in which the good priest resided, which was
some two leagues from her home. He wisely suggests that, perhaps,
listening to some tale of sorcery, she had had a vivid dream, in which
she seemed to take this flight. It is obvious, however, from his
account, as well as from other sources, that the belief of the
transformation into lower animals was and is one familiar to the
superstitions of the Mayas.<a name="FNanchor_25-2_47" id="FNanchor_25-2_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_25-2_47" class="fnanchor">25-&#8224;</a> The natives still continue to
propitiate the ancient gods of the harvest, at the beginning of the
season assembling at a ceremony called by the Spaniards the <i>misa
milpera</i>, or &#8220;field mass,&#8221; and by themselves <i>ti&#8217;ch</i>, &#8220;the stretching
out of the hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>The German traveler, Dr. Scherzer, when he visited, in 1854, the remote
hamlet of Istlavacan, in Guatemala, peopled by Quich&eacute; Indians,
discovered that they had preserved in this respect the usages of their
ancestors almost wholly unaffected by the teachings of their various
Christian curates. The &#8220;Master&#8221; still assigned the <i>naguals</i> to the
new-born infants, copal was burned to their ancient gods in remote
caves, and formulas of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> invocation were taught by the veteran nagualists
to their neophytes.<a name="FNanchor_26-1_48" id="FNanchor_26-1_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_26-1_48" class="fnanchor">26-*</a></p>

<p>These <i>Zahoris</i>,<a name="FNanchor_26-2_49" id="FNanchor_26-2_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_26-2_49" class="fnanchor">26-&#8224;</a> as they are generally called in the Spanish of
Central America, possessed many other mysterious arts besides that of
such metamorphoses and of forecasting the future. They could make
themselves invisible, and walk unseen among their enemies; they could in
a moment transport themselves to distant places, and, as quickly
returning, report what they had witnessed; they could create before the
eyes of the spectator a river, a tree, a house, or an animal, where none
such existed; they could cut open their own stomach, or lop a limb from
another person, and immediately heal the wound or restore the severed
member to its place; they could pierce themselves with knives and not
bleed, or handle venomous serpents and not be bitten; they could cause
mysterious sounds in the air, and fascinate animals and persons by their
steady gaze; they could call visible and invisible spirits, and the
spirits would come.</p>

<p>Among the native population of the State of Vera Cruz and elsewhere in
southern Mexico these mysterious personages go by the name <i>padrinos</i>,
godfathers, and are looked upon with a mixture of fear and respect. They
are believed by the Indians to be able to cause sickness and domestic
calamities, and are pronounced by intelligent whites to present &#8220;a
combination of rascality, duplicity and trickery.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_26-3_50" id="FNanchor_26-3_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_26-3_50" class="fnanchor">26-&#8225;</a></p>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_17" id="section_17"></a><b>17.</b> The details of the ceremonies and doctrines of Nagualism have never
been fully revealed; but from isolated occurrences and partial
confessions it is clear that its adherents formed a coherent association
extending over most of southern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span> Mexico and Guatemala, which everywhere
was inspired by two ruling sentiments&mdash;detestation of the Spaniards and
hatred of the Christian religion.</p>

<p>In their eyes the latter was but a cloak for the exactions, massacres
and oppressions exerted by the former. To them the sacraments of the
Church were the outward signs of their own subjugation and misery. They
revolted against these rites in open hatred, or received them with
secret repugnance and contempt. In the Mexican figurative manuscripts
composed after the conquest the rite of baptism is constantly depicted
as the symbol of religious persecution. Says a sympathetic student of
this subject:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The act of baptism is always inserted in their records of battles
and massacres. Everywhere it conveys the same idea,&mdash;making evident
to the reader that the pretext for all the military expeditions of
the Spaniards was the enforced conversion to Christianity of the
natives; a pretext on which the Spaniards seized in order to
possess themselves of the land and its treasure, to rob the Indians
of their wives and daughters, to enslave them, and to spill their
blood without remorse or remission. One of these documents, dated
in 1526, adds a trait of savage irony. A Spanish soldier is
represented dragging a fugitive Indian from a lake by a lasso
around his neck; while on the shore stands a monk ready to baptize
the recreant on his arrival!&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_27-1_51" id="FNanchor_27-1_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_27-1_51" class="fnanchor">27-*</a></p></div>

<p>No wonder that the priests of the dark ritual of Nagualism for centuries
after the conquest sought to annul the effects of the hated Christian
sacraments by counteracting ceremonies of their own, as we are told they
did by the historian Torquemada, writing from his own point of view in
these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The Father of Lies had his ministers who aided him, magicians and
sorcerers, who went about from town to town, persuading the simple
people to that which the Enemy of Light desired. Those who believed
their deceits, and had been baptized, were washed on the head and
breast by these sorcerers, who assured them that this would remove
the effects of the chrism and the holy oils. I myself knew an
instance where a person of prominence, who resided not far from the
City of Mexico, was dying, and had received extreme unction; and
when the priest had departed one of these diabolical ceremonialists
entered, and washed all the parts which had been anointed by the
holy oil with the intention to destroy its power.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_27-2_52" id="FNanchor_27-2_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_27-2_52" class="fnanchor">27-&#8224;</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Similar instances are recorded by Jacinto de la Serna. He adds that not
only did the Masters prescribe sacrifices to the Fire in order to annul
the effects of extreme unction, but they delighted to caricature the
Eucharist, dividing among their congregation a narcotic yellow mushroom
for the bread, and the inebriating pulque for the wine. Sometimes they
adroitly concealed in the pyx, alongside the holy wafer, some little
idol of their own, so that they really followed their own superstitions
while seemingly adoring the Host. They assigned a purely pagan sense to
the sacred formula, &#8220;Father, Son and Holy Ghost,&#8221; understanding it to be
&#8220;Fire, Earth and Air,&#8221; or the like.<a name="FNanchor_28-1_53" id="FNanchor_28-1_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_28-1_53" class="fnanchor">28-*</a></p>

<p>Whoever or whatever was an enemy to that religion so brutally forced upon
these miserable creatures was to them an ally and a friend. Nu&ntilde;ez de la
Vega tells us that he found written formulas among them reading: &#8220;O
Brother Antichrist, Brother Antichrist, Brother Antichrist, come to our
aid!&#8221;&mdash;pathetic and desperate appeal of a wretched race, ground to earth
under the iron heels of a religious and military despotism.<a name="FNanchor_28-2_54" id="FNanchor_28-2_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_28-2_54" class="fnanchor">28-&#8224;</a></p>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_18" id="section_18"></a><b>18.</b> The association embraced various tribes and its members were
classified under different degrees. The initiation into these was by
solemn and often painful ceremonies. Local sodalities or brotherhoods
were organized after the manner of those usual in the Roman Church; but
instead of being named after St. John or the Virgin Mary they were
dedicated to Judas Iscariot or Pontius Pilate out of derision and hatred
of the teachings of the priests; or to the Devil or Antichrist, who were
looked upon as powerful divinities in opposition to the Church.<a name="FNanchor_28-3_55" id="FNanchor_28-3_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_28-3_55" class="fnanchor">28-&#8225;</a></p>

<p>There were certain recognized centres of the association, near which its
most important dignitaries resided, and where their secret councils and
most imposing ceremonies were held. One of these was Zamayac, in the
province of Suchiltepec; a second near Huehuetan, Soconusco; a third at
Totonicapan, Guate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>mala; a fourth at Cancuc, Chiapas; a fifth at
Teozapotlan, Oaxaca; and a few others may be surmised.</p>

<p>The high priest who resided at each of these centres exercised control
over all the nagualistic teachers and practitioners in an extensive
district. On the occasion of an official inquiry by the Spanish
authorities it was ascertained that the high priest of Zamayac included
under his rule nearly one thousand sub-priests,<a name="FNanchor_29-1_56" id="FNanchor_29-1_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_29-1_56" class="fnanchor">29-*</a> and no doubt
others of his rank were not less potent.</p>

<p>The unity between the members of the association over an indefinitely
wide area was perfectly well known to the Spanish priests and civil
authorities. The ceremonies, formulas and methods of procedure were
everywhere identical or alike. This itself was justly regarded as a
proof of the secret intelligence which existed among the members of this
cabalistic guild.<a name="FNanchor_29-2_57" id="FNanchor_29-2_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_29-2_57" class="fnanchor">29-&#8224;</a></p>

<p>To a certain extent, and at least in some localities, as Chiapas and
Guatemala, the priesthood of Nagualism was hereditary in particular
families. This is especially stated by the historian Ordo&ntilde;ez y Aguiar,
who had exceptional opportunities for acquainting himself with the
facts.<a name="FNanchor_29-3_58" id="FNanchor_29-3_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_29-3_58" class="fnanchor">29-&#8225;</a></p>

<p>A traveler of the first decade of this century, who has left us a number
of curious details of the superstitions of the Christianized Indians in
Mexico of that day, Benito Maria de Mox&ograve;, informs us that he had
discovered the existence of different grades in the native soothsayers
and medicine men, and that all in a given locality recognized the
supremacy of one whom they referred to as &#8220;the little old man,&#8221; <i>El
Viejito</i>. But he was unable to ascertain by what superior traits or
rights he obtained this distinction.<a name="FNanchor_29-4_59" id="FNanchor_29-4_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_29-4_59" class="fnanchor">29-&sect;</a></p>

<p>According to some authorities, the highest grade of these native
hierophants bore among the Nahuas the symbolic name<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span> of &#8220;flower
weavers,&#8221; <i>Xochimilca</i>, probably from the skill they had to deceive the
senses by strange and pleasant visions.<a name="FNanchor_30-1_60" id="FNanchor_30-1_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_30-1_60" class="fnanchor">30-*</a> In the south they were
spoken of as &#8220;guardians,&#8221; which may have been derived from the classes
of priests so-called in the Zapotec religion.<a name="FNanchor_30-2_61" id="FNanchor_30-2_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_30-2_61" class="fnanchor">30-&#8224;</a></p>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_19" id="section_19"></a><b>19.</b> It will be seen from the above, that Nagualism, beginning in an
ancient superstition dating back to the time of primitive barbarism,
became after the Conquest a potent factor in the political and social
development of the peoples among whom it existed; that it was the source
from which was drawn and the means by which was sustained the
race-hatred of the native American towards his foreign conquerors,
smouldering for centuries, now and then breaking out in furious revolt
and civil war.</p>

<p>There is strong reason to suspect its power where, for obvious reasons,
it has not been demonstrated. It has always been a mystery and a matter
of surprise to the historians of Yucatan how rapidly spread the plans of
the insurrection which secured lasting independence for the natives,
after these plans had been agreed upon by the two chiefs, Antonio Ay and
Cecilio Chi, at the remote rancho of Xihum, in July, 1847. Such
unanimity of action could only have been possible through the aid of a
powerful, well-disciplined and widespread secret organization. There can
scarcely be a doubt they were the chiefs or masters of the redoubtable
order of Nagualism in the Peninsula.<a name="FNanchor_30-3_62" id="FNanchor_30-3_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_30-3_62" class="fnanchor">30-&#8225;</a></p>

<p>There is no question that such was the case with the brief and bloody
revolt of the Mayas in 1761. It suddenly broke out in a number of
villages near Valladolid, Yucatan, headed by a full-blood native,
Jacinto Can-Ek; but some of the participants afterwards confessed that
it was the outcome of a conspiracy which had been preparing for a year.</p>

<p>When the appointed day arrived, Jacinto boldly announced himself as the
high priest of the fraternity of sorcerers, a master and teacher of
magic, and the lineal successor of the famous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span> ancient prophet, Chilan
Balam, &#8220;whose words cannot fail.&#8221; In a stirring appeal he urged his
fellow-countrymen to attack the Spaniards without fear of consequences.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;&#8216;Be not afraid,&#8217; he exclaimed, &#8216;of their cannons and their forts;
for among the many to whom I have taught the arts of magic (el arte
de brujeria) there are fifteen chosen ones, marvelous experts, who
by their mystic power will enter the fortress, slay the sentinels,
and throw open the gates to our warriors. I shall take the leaves
of the sacred tree, and folding them into trumpets, I shall call to
the four winds of heaven, and a multitude of fighting men will
hasten to our aid.&#8217;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_31-1_63" id="FNanchor_31-1_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_31-1_63" class="fnanchor">31-*</a></p></div>

<p>Saying this, he took a sheet of paper, held it up to show that it was
blank, folded it for a moment, and then spread it out covered with
writing! This deft trick convinced his simple-minded hearers of the
truth of his claims and they rushed to arms. He led them, clothed in the
robe of the Virgin and with her crown on his head. But neither their
enthusiasm nor their leader&#8217;s art magic availed, and soon Jacinto and
his followers fell victims to the stake and the gallows. After their
death the dance of &#8220;the tiger,&#8221; or of Chac-Mool&mdash;the &#8220;ghost dance&#8221; of
the Mayas&mdash;was prohibited; and the use of the sacred drum&mdash;the favorite
instrument of the native priests&mdash;was forbidden.<a name="FNanchor_31-2_64" id="FNanchor_31-2_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_31-2_64" class="fnanchor">31-&#8224;</a></p>

<p>In fact, wherever we have any full accounts of the revolts against the
Spanish domination during the three centuries of its existence in New
Spain, we can manifestly trace the guiding fingers of the powerful
though hidden hand of Nagualism. An earlier revolt of the Mayas in
Yucatan occurred in 1585. It was led by Andres Chi, a full-blood Indian,
and a descendant of the ancient royal house of the Cocomes. He also
announced himself as a priest of the ancient faith, a prophet and a
worker of miracles, sent to instruct his own people in a new religion
and to give them an independent political existence. Seized by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span> the
Spaniards, he was charged with idolatry, sorcery and disturbing the
peace, and was ignominiously hanged.<a name="FNanchor_32-1_65" id="FNanchor_32-1_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_32-1_65" class="fnanchor">32-*</a></p>

<p>Not less definitely inspired by the same ideas was the Mixe Indian,
known as &#8220;Don Pascual,&#8221; who led the revolt of the Tehuantepec tribes in
1661. He sent out his summons to the &#8220;thirteen governors of the Zapotecs
and Chontales&#8221; to come to his aid, and the insurrection threatened to
assume formidable proportions, prevented only by bringing to bear upon
the natives the whole power of the Roman Church through the Bishop of
Oaxaca, Cuevas Davalos.<a name="FNanchor_32-2_66" id="FNanchor_32-2_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_32-2_66" class="fnanchor">32-&#8224;</a></p>

<p>Nearly the same locality had been the scene of the revolt of the
Zapotecs in 1550, when they were led by a native priest who claimed to
be an incarnation of the old god Quetzalcoatl, the patron deity of the
nagualists.<a name="FNanchor_32-3_67" id="FNanchor_32-3_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_32-3_67" class="fnanchor">32-&#8225;</a></p>

<p>In the city of Mexico itself, in the year 1692, there was a violent
outbreak of the natives, when they destroyed three million dollars worth
of property. Doubtless this was partly attributable to the scarcity of
food which prevailed; but that the authorities traced it also to some
secret ceremonials is evident from the law which was immediately passed
forbidding the Indians to wear the <i>piochtli</i>, or scalp-lock, a portion
of the hair preserved from birth as part of the genethliac
rituals,<a name="FNanchor_32-4_68" id="FNanchor_32-4_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_32-4_68" class="fnanchor">32-&sect;</a> and the especial enactments against the <i>octli</i>.</p>

<p>As for the revolt of the Tzentals of Chiapas, in 1712, it was clearly
and confessedly under the leadership of the nagualistic priesthood, as I
shall indicate on a later page.</p>

<p>The history of the native American race under the Spanish power in North
America has never yet been written with the slightest approach to
thoroughness. He who properly qualifies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span> himself for that task will
certainly reach the conclusion expressed a number of years ago by the
eminent American antiquary and historian, Mr. E. G. Squier, in these
words:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Among the ruling and priestly classes of the semi-civilized
nations of America, there has always existed a mysterious bond, a
secret organization, which all the disasters to which they have
been subjected have not destroyed. It is to its present existence
that we may attribute those simultaneous movements of the
aborigines of Mexico and Central America, which have more than once
threatened the complete subversion of the Spanish power.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_33-1_69" id="FNanchor_33-1_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_33-1_69" class="fnanchor">33-*</a></p></div>

<p>That mysterious bond, that secret organization, is <i>Nagualism</i>.</p>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_20" id="section_20"></a><b>20.</b> A remarkable feature in this mysterious society was the exalted
position it assigned to Women. Not only were they admitted to the most
esoteric degrees, but in repeated instances they occupied the very
highest posts in the organization. According to the traditions of the
Tzentals and Pipils of Chiapas, when their national hero, Votan,
constructed by the breath of his mouth his darkened shrine at
Tlazoaloyan, in Soconusco, he deposited in it the sacred books and holy
relics, and constituted a college of venerable sages to be its
guardians; but placed them all in subjection to a high priestess, whose
powers were absolute.<a name="FNanchor_33-2_70" id="FNanchor_33-2_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_33-2_70" class="fnanchor">33-&#8224;</a></p>

<p>The veracious Pascual de Andagoya asserts from his own knowledge that
some of these female adepts had attained the rare and peculiar power of
being in two places at once, as much as a league and a half
apart;<a name="FNanchor_33-3_71" id="FNanchor_33-3_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_33-3_71" class="fnanchor">33-&#8225;</a> and the repeated references to them in the Spanish
writings of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries confirm the dread in
which they were held and the extensive influence they were known to
control. In the sacraments of Nagualism, Woman was the primate and
hierophant.</p>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_21" id="section_21"></a><b>21.</b> This was a lineal inheritance from pre-Columbian times. In many
native American legends, as in others from the old world, some powerful
enchantress is remembered as the founder of the State, mistress of men
through the potency of her magic powers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>Such, among the Aztecs, was the sorceress who built the city of
Mallinalco, on the road from Mexico to Michoacan, famous even after the
conquest for the skill of its magicians, who claimed descent from
her.<a name="FNanchor_34-1_72" id="FNanchor_34-1_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_34-1_72" class="fnanchor">34-*</a> Such, in Honduras, was Coamizagual, queen of Cerquin, versed
in all occult science, who died not, but at the close of her earthly
career rose to heaven in the form of a beautiful bird, amid the roll of
thunder and the flash of lightning.<a name="FNanchor_34-2_73" id="FNanchor_34-2_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_34-2_73" class="fnanchor">34-&#8224;</a></p>

<p>According to an author intimately familiar with the Mexican nagualists,
the art they claimed to possess of transforming themselves into the
lower animals was taught their predecessors by a woman, a native Circe,
a mighty enchantress, whose usual name was Quilaztli (the etymology of
which is unknown), but who bore also four others, representing her four
metamorphoses, Cohuacihuatl, the Serpent Woman; Quauhcihuatl, the Eagle
Woman; Yaocihuatl, the Warrior Woman; and Tzitzimecihuatl, the Specter
Woman.<a name="FNanchor_34-3_74" id="FNanchor_34-3_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_34-3_74" class="fnanchor">34-&#8225;</a></p>

<p>The powers of these queens of magic extended widely among their sex. We
read in the chronicles of ancient Mexico that when Nezahualpilli, the
king, oppressed the tribes of the coast, the <i>tierra caliente</i>, they
sent against him, not their warriors, but their witches. These cast upon
him their fatal spells, so that when he walked forth from his palace,
blood burst from his mouth, and he fell prone and dead.<a name="FNanchor_34-4_75" id="FNanchor_34-4_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_34-4_75" class="fnanchor">34-&sect;</a></p>

<p>In Guatemala, as in ancient Delphos, the gods were believed to speak
through the mouths of these inspired seeresses, and at the celebration
of victories they enjoyed a privilege so strange and horrible that I
quote it from the old manuscript before me without venturing a
translation:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;... Despues de sacrificar los antiguos algun hombre,
despeda&ccedil;andolo, si era de los que avian cogido en guerra, dicen que
guardaban el<span class='pagenum' style="font-size: 89%;"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span> miembro genital y los testiculos del tal sacrificado,
y se los daban &agrave; una vieja que tenian por profeta, para que los
comiese, y le pedian rogasse &agrave; su idolo les diesse mas
captivos.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_35-1_76" id="FNanchor_35-1_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_35-1_76" class="fnanchor">35-*</a></p></div>

<p>When Captain Pedro de Alvarado, in the year 1524, was marching upon
Quetzaltanango, in Guatemala, just such a fearful old witch took her
stand at the summit of the pass, with her familiar in the shape of a
dog, and &#8220;by spells and nagualistic incantations&#8221; undertook to prevent
his approach.<a name="FNanchor_35-2_77" id="FNanchor_35-2_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_35-2_77" class="fnanchor">35-&#8224;</a></p>

<p>As in the earliest, so in the latest accounts. The last revolt of the
Indians of Chiapas occurred among the Zotzils in 1869. The cause of it
was the seizure and imprisonment by the Spanish authorities of a
&#8220;mystical woman,&#8221; known to the whites as Santa Rosa, who, together with
one of their <i>ahaus</i> or chieftains, had been suspected of fomenting
sedition. The natives marched thousands strong against the city of San
Cristobal, where the prisoners were, and secured their liberation; but
their leader, Ignacio Galindo, was entrapped and shot by the Spaniards,
and the mutiny was soon quelled.<a name="FNanchor_35-3_78" id="FNanchor_35-3_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_35-3_78" class="fnanchor">35-&#8225;</a></p>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_22" id="section_22"></a><b>22.</b> But perhaps the most striking instance is that recorded in the
history of the insurrection of the Tzentals of Chiapas, in 1713. They
were led by an Indian girl, a native Joan of Arc, fired by like
enthusiasm to drive from her country the hated foreign oppressors, and
to destroy every vestige of their presence. She was scarcely twenty
years old, and was known to the Spaniards as Maria Candelaria. She was
the leader of what most historians call a religious sect, but what
Ordo&ntilde;ez y Aguiar, himself a native of Chiapas, recognizes as the
powerful secret association of Nagualism, determined on the extirpation
of the white race. He estimates that in Chiapas alone there were nearly
seventy thousand natives under her orders&mdash;doubtless an
exaggeration&mdash;and asserts that the conspiracy extended far into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span> the
neighboring tribes, who had been ordered to await the result of the
effort in Chiapas.</p>

<p>Her authority was absolute, and she was merciless in requiring obedience
to it. The disobedient were flayed alive or roasted over a slow fire.
She and all her followers took particular pleasure in manifesting their
hatred and contempt for the religion of their oppressors. They defiled
the sacred vessels of the churches, imitated with buffoonery the
ceremonies of the mass, which she herself performed, and stoned to death
the priests whom they caught.</p>

<p>Of course, her attempt against the power of Spain was hopeless. It
failed after a bitter and protracted conquest, characterized by the
utmost inhumanity on both sides. But when her followers were scattered
and killed, when the victorious whites had again in their hands all the
power and resources of the country, not their most diligent search, nor
the temptation of any reward, enabled them to capture Maria Candelaria,
the heroine of the bloody drama. With a few trusty followers she escaped
to the forest, and was never again heard of.<a name="FNanchor_36-1_79" id="FNanchor_36-1_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_36-1_79" class="fnanchor">36-*</a></p>

<p>More unfortunate were her friends and lieutenants, the priestesses of
Guistiupan and Yajalon, who had valiantly seconded Maria in her
patriotic endeavors. Seized by the Spaniards, they met the fate which we
can easily imagine, though the historian has mercifully thrown a veil on
its details.<a name="FNanchor_36-2_80" id="FNanchor_36-2_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_36-2_80" class="fnanchor">36-&#8224;</a></p>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_23" id="section_23"></a><b>23.</b> Of just such a youthful prophetess did Mr. E. G. Squier hear during
his travels in Central America, a &#8220;<i>sukia</i> woman,&#8221; as she was called by
the coast Indians, one who lived alone mid the ruins of an old Mayan
temple, a sorceress of twenty years, loved and feared, holding death and
life in her hands.<a name="FNanchor_36-3_81" id="FNanchor_36-3_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_36-3_81" class="fnanchor">36-&#8225;</a> Per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>haps his account is somewhat fanciful;
it is so, indeed; but it is grounded on the unshaken beliefs and ancient
traditions of the natives of those climes, and on customs well known to
those who reside there.</p>

<p>The late distinguished Americanist, the Abb&eacute; Brasseur de Bourbourg,
during his long travels in Mexico and Central America, had occasion more
than once to come in contact with this trait of the ancient faith of the
Nagualists, still alive in their descendants. Among the Zapotecs of the
Isthmus of Tehuantepec he saw one of the queens of the mystic
fraternity, and he describes her with a warmth which proves that he had
not lost his eye for the beautiful.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;She wore a piece of light-green stuff loosely folded around her
form at the hips, and falling to a little distance above the ankle;
a jacket of red silk gauze with short sleeves and embroidered with
gold, clothed the upper part of her person, veiling her bosom, upon
which lay a chain of heavy gold pieces, pierced and strung on a
cord. Her rich black hair was divided on the forehead, and drawn
back in two splendid tresses fastened with blue ribbons, while a
white muslin kerchief encircled her head like the calantica of the
ancient Egyptians. Never in my life have I seen a more striking
figure of an Isis or a Cleopatra.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was something strange in her expression. Her eyes were the
blackest and the brightest in the world; but there were moments
when she suddenly paused, leaned against the billiard table or the
wall, and they became fixed and dead like those of a corpse. Then a
fiery glance would shoot from beneath her dark lashes, sending a
chill to the heart of the one to whom it was directed. Was it
madness, or was it, as those around her believed, a momentary
absence of soul, an absorption of her spirit into its <i>nagual</i>, a
transportation into an unknown world? Who shall decide?&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_37-1_82" id="FNanchor_37-1_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_37-1_82" class="fnanchor">37-*</a></p></div>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_24" id="section_24"></a><b>24.</b> It would be a mistake to suppose that Nagualism was an incoherent
medley of superstitions, a mass of jumbled fragments derived from the
ancient paganism. My study of it has led me to a widely different
conclusion. It was a perpetuation of a well-defined portion of the
native cult, whose sources we are able to trace long anterior to the
period of the conquest, and which had no connection with the elaborate
and bloody ritual of the Aztecs. The evidence to this effect is cogent.</p>

<p>Wherever in later days the Catholic priests found out the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span> holy places
and sacred objects of the nagualists, they were in-caves or deep
rock-recesses, not in artificial structures. The myths they gleaned, and
the names of the gods they heard, also point to this as a distinguishing
peculiarity. An early instance is recorded among the Nahuas of Mexico.
In 1537 Father Perea discovered a cavern in a deep ravine at Chalma,
near Mallinalco (a town famous for its magicians), which was the
sanctuary of the deity called <i>Oztoteotl</i>, the Cave God (<i>oztotl</i>, cave;
<i>teotl</i>, god), &#8220;venerated throughout the whole empire of
Montezuma.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_38-1_83" id="FNanchor_38-1_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_38-1_83" class="fnanchor">38-*</a> He destroyed the image of the god, and converted the
cavern into a chapel.</p>

<p>We cannot err in regarding Oztoteotl as merely another name of the
Nahuatl divinity, Tepeyollotl, the Heart, or Inside, of the Mountain,
who in the Codex Borgia and the Codex Vaticanus is represented seated
upon or in a cavern. His name may equally well be translated &#8220;the Heart
of the Place,&#8221; or &#8220;of the Town.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Eduard Seler has shown beyond reasonable question that this divinity
did not originally belong to the Aztec Pantheon, but was introduced from
the South, either from the Zapotecs, the Mixtecs, or the Mayan tribes,
beyond these.<a name="FNanchor_38-2_84" id="FNanchor_38-2_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_38-2_84" class="fnanchor">38-&#8224;</a> The Cave God of the Aztecs is identical with the
Votan of the Tzentals of Chiapas, and with the U-q&#8217;ux Uleuh of the
Quiches of Guatemala, and probably with the Cozaana of the Zapotecs.</p>

<p>The rites of all of these were conducted in caverns, and there have been
preserved several interesting descriptions of the contents of these
sacred places. That relating to the &#8220;dark house of Votan&#8221; is given thus
in the work of the Bishop of Chiapas:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Votan is the third hero who is named in the calendar, and some of
his descendants still reside in the town of Teopisca, where they
are known as Votans. He is sometimes referred to as Lord of the
Sacred Drum, and he is said to have seen the great wall (which must
have been the Tower of Babel), and to have divided this land among
the Indians, and given to each tribe its language.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum' style="font-size: 89%;"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>&#8220;They say further that he once dwelt in Huehuetan, a town in the
province of Soconusco. Near there, at the place called Tlazoaloyan,
he constructed, by blowing with his breath, a dark house, and put
tapirs in the river, and in the house a great treasure, and left
all in charge of a noble lady, assisted by guardians (<i>tlapiane</i>)
to preserve. This treasure consisted of earthenware vases with
covers of the same material; a stone, on which were inscribed the
figures of the ancient native heroes as found in the calendar;
<i>chalchiuites</i>, which are green stones; and other superstitious
objects.</p>

<p>&#8220;All of these were taken from the cave, and publicly burned in the
plaza of Huehuetan on the occasion of our first diocesan visit
there in 1691, having been delivered to us by the lady in charge
and the guardians. All the Indians have great respect for this
Votan, and in some places they call him &#8216;the Heart of the
Towns.&#8217;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_39-1_85" id="FNanchor_39-1_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_39-1_85" class="fnanchor">39-*</a></p></div>

<p>The English priest, Thomas Gage, who was curate of a parish among the
Pokonchi Indians of Guatemala about 1630, relates his discovery of such
a cave, in which the idol was preserved, and gives this description of
it:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;We found the Idol standing upon a low stool covered with a linen
cloth. The substance of it was wood, black shining like jet, as if
it had been painted or smoked; the form was of a man&#8217;s head unto
the shoulders, without either Beard or Mustachoes; his look was
grim, with a wrinkled forehead, and broad staring eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;They boasted of this their god, saying that he had plainly told
them they should not believe anything I preached of Christ, but
follow the old ways of their forefathers.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_39-2_86" id="FNanchor_39-2_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_39-2_86" class="fnanchor">39-&#8224;</a></p></div>

<p>The black color here mentioned was a relic of ancient symbolism,
referring to the night, darkness, and the obscurity of the holy cavern.
Vetancurt informs us that the priests of the ancient paganism were
accustomed to rub their faces and bodies with an ointment of fat and
pine soot when they went to sacrifice in the forests, so that they
looked as black as <a name="corr3" title="corr3"></a><ins class="correction" title="negroes.">negroes</ins><a name="FNanchor_39-3_87" id="FNanchor_39-3_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_39-3_87" class="fnanchor">39-&#8225;</a> In the extract from Nu&ntilde;ez de
la Vega already given, <i>Ical Ahau</i>, the &#8220;Black King,&#8221; is named as one of
the divinities of the nagualists.</p>

<p>In some parts the principal idol found in the caves was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> mummied or
exsiccated body of some former distinguished priest or chieftain. One
such is recorded by Bartholom&eacute; de Pisa, which was found among the
Zapotecs of Coatlan. It bore a name taken from the calendar, that of the
tenth day, and was alleged to be the preserved cadaver of a celebrated
ruler.<a name="FNanchor_40-1_88" id="FNanchor_40-1_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_40-1_88" class="fnanchor">40-*</a> Another interesting example is narrated by Villa Se&ntilde;or y
Sanchez,<a name="FNanchor_40-2_89" id="FNanchor_40-2_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_40-2_89" class="fnanchor">40-&#8224;</a> who describes it as an eye-witness. It was discovered
in a spacious cave located some distance to the west of the city of
Mexico, in Nahuatl territory, on the side of what was known as &#8220;the Sun
mountain&#8221;&mdash;<i>la Mesa de Tonati</i>. He speaks of it as remarkably well
preserved, &#8220;both the muscles and the bones.&#8221;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;It was seated in an armchair which served for a throne, and was
clothed in a mantle, which fell from the shoulders to the feet.
This was richly adorned with precious stones, which, according to
the native custom, were sewed into the texture of the cloth. The
figure also wore shoulder straps, collars, bracelets and fastenings
of silver. From its forehead rose a crown of beautiful feathers of
different colors arranged so that one color should alternate with
another. The left hand was resting on the arm of the chair, while
in the right was a sharp cutlass with silver mountings. At its feet
were several vases of fine stone, as marble and alabaster, in which
were offerings of blood and meat, obtained from the sacrifices.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The same writer refers to other examples of these sacred caves which he
had seen in his journeys. One was near the town of Teremendo, where the
sides and roof had been artificially dressed into the shape of huge
arches. A natural altar had been provided in a similar manner, and on
it, at the time of his visit, were numerous idols in the figures of men
and animals, and before them fresh offerings of copal and food.
Elsewhere he refers to many such caverns still in use as places resorted
to by the natives in <i>la gran Sierra de Tlascala</i>.<a name="FNanchor_40-3_90" id="FNanchor_40-3_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_40-3_90" class="fnanchor">40-&#8225;</a></p>

<p>These extracts prove the extent of this peculiar worship and the number
of these subterranean temples in recent generations. The fame of some of
the greater ones of the past still survives, as the vast grotto of
Chalcatongo, near Achiutla, which was the sepulchral vault of its
ancient kings; that of Totomachiapa, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> solemn scene of sacrifice for
the ancient priests; that of Justlahuaca, near Sola (Oaxaca), which was
a place of worship of the Zapotecs long after the Conquest; and that in
the Cerro de Monopostiac, near San Francisco del Mar.<a name="FNanchor_41-1_91" id="FNanchor_41-1_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_41-1_91" class="fnanchor">41-*</a></p>

<p>The intimate meaning of this cave-cult was the worship of the Earth. The
Cave God, the Heart of the Hills, really typified the Earth, the Soil,
from whose dark recesses flow the limpid streams and spring the tender
shoots of the food-plants, as well as the great trees. To the native
Mexican, the Earth was the provider of food and drink, the common Father
of All; so that to this day, when he would take a solemn oath, he stoops
to the earth, touches it with his hand, and repeats the solemn formula:
<i>Cuix amo nechitla in toteotzin?</i> &#8220;Does not our Great God see me?&#8221;</p>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_25" id="section_25"></a><b>25.</b> The identity of the Tepeyollotl of the Nahuas and the Votan of the
Tzentals is shown not only in the oneness of meaning of the names, but
in the fact that both represent the <i>third</i> day in the ritual calendar.
For this reason I take it, we find the number <i>three</i> so generally a
sacred number in the symbolism of the nagualists. We have already
learned in the extract from Nu&ntilde;ez de la Vega that the neophytes were
instructed in classes of three. To this day in Soteapan the fasts and

nagualists chose him as their special protector. As already seen, in
Guatemala the child finally accepted its <i>naual</i> when seven years old;
and among some of the Nahuatl tribes of Mexico the <i>tonal</i> and the
calendar name was formally assigned on the seventh day after
birth.<a name="FNanchor_42-2_97" id="FNanchor_42-2_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_42-2_97" class="fnanchor">42-&#8224;</a> From similar impressions the Cakchiquels of Guatemala

<p>The three and the seven were the ruling numbers in the genealogical
trees of the Pipiles of San Salvador. The &#8220;tree&#8221; was painted with
<i>seven</i> branches representing degrees of relationship within which
marriage was forbidden unless a man had performed some distinguished
exploit in war, when he could marry beyond the nearest <i>three</i> degrees

<p>The indications are that the nagualists derived these numbers from the
third and seventh days of the calendar &#8220;month&#8221; of twenty days.
Tepeololtec, the Cave God, was patron of the third day and also &#8220;Lord of
Animals,&#8221; the transformation into which was the test of nagualistic

Gukumatz, all names meaning this), represented as carrying his medicine

<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_26" id="section_26"></a><b>26.</b> The nagualistic rites were highly symbolic, and the symbols used had
clearly defined meanings, which enable us to analyze the religious ideas
underlying this mysterious cult.</p>

<p>The most important symbol was Fire. It was regarded as the primal
element and the immediate source of life. Father Nicolas de Leon has the
following suggestive passage in this connection:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;If any of their old superstitions has remained more deeply rooted
than another in the hearts of these Indians, both men and women, it
is this about fire and its worship, and about making new fire and
preserving it for a year in secret places. We should be on the
watch for this, and when in their confessions they speak of what
the Fire said and how the Fire wept, expressions which we are apt
to pass by as unintelligible, we must lay our hands on them for
reprehension. We should also be on the watch for their baptism by
Fire, a ceremony called the <i>yiahuiltoca</i>,<a name="FNanchor_43-2_103" id="FNanchor_43-2_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_43-2_103" class="fnanchor">43-&#8224;</a> shortly after
the birth of a child when they bestow on it the surnames; nor must
the lying-in women and their assistants be permitted to speak of
Fire as the father and mother of all things and the author of
nature; because it is a common saying with them that Fire is
present at the birth and death of every creature.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>This curious ceremony derived its name from the <i>yiahuitli</i>, a plant not
unlike the absinthe, the powdered leaves of which, according to Father
Sahagun, the natives were accustomed to throw into the flames as an
offering to the fire.<a name="FNanchor_43-3_104" id="FNanchor_43-3_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_43-3_104" class="fnanchor">43-&#8225;</a> Long after the conquest, and probably to
this day, the same custom prevails in Mexico, the fumes and odor of the
burning leaves being considered very salubrious and purifying to the air
of the sick <a name="corr4" title="corr4"></a><ins class="correction" title="room.">room</ins><a name="FNanchor_43-4_105" id="FNanchor_43-4_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_43-4_105" class="fnanchor">43-&sect;</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>The word <i>yiahuiltoca</i> means &#8220;the throwing of the <i>yiauhtli</i>&#8221; (from
<i>toca</i>, to throw upon with the hands). Another name for the ceremony,
according to Father Vetancurt, who wrote a century later than Leon, was
<i>apehualco</i>, which has substantially the same meaning, &#8220;a throwing upon&#8221;
or &#8220;a throwing away.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_44-1_106" id="FNanchor_44-1_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_44-1_106" class="fnanchor">44-*</a> He adds the interesting particulars that it
was celebrated on the fourth day after the birth of the child, during
which time it was deemed essential to keep the fire burning in the
house, but not to permit any of it to be carried out, as that would
bring bad luck to the child.</p>

<p>Jacinto de la Serna also describes this ceremony, to which he gives the
name <i>tlecuixtliliztli</i>, &#8220;which means that they pass the infant over the
fire;&#8221; and elsewhere he adds: &#8220;The worship of fire is the greatest
stumbling-block to these wretched idolaters.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_44-2_107" id="FNanchor_44-2_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_44-2_107" class="fnanchor">44-&#8224;</a></p>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_27" id="section_27"></a><b>27.</b> Other ceremonies connected with fire worship took place in
connection with the manufacture of the pulque, or <i>octli</i>, the fermented
liquor obtained from the sap of the maguey plant. The writer just
quoted, de Vetancurt, states that the natives in his day, when they had
brewed the new pulque and it was ready to be drunk, first built a fire,
walked in procession around it and threw some of the new liquor into the
flames, chanting the while an invocation to the god of inebriation,
Tezcatzoncatl, to descend and be present with them.</p>

<p>This was distinctly a survival of an ancient doctrine which connected
the God of Fire with the Gods of Drunkenness, as we may gather from the
following quotation from the history composed by Father Diego Duran:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The <i>octli</i> was a favorite offering to the gods, and especially to
the God of Fire. Sometimes it was placed before a fire in vases,
sometimes<span class='pagenum' style="font-size: 89%;"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> it was scattered upon the flames with a brush, at other
times it was poured out around the fireplace.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_45-1_108" id="FNanchor_45-1_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_45-1_108" class="fnanchor">45-*</a></p></div>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_28" id="section_28"></a><b>28.</b> The high importance of the fire ceremonies in the secret rituals of
the modern Mayas is plainly evident from the native Calendars, although
their signification has eluded the researches of students, even of the
laborious Pio Perez, who was so intimately acquainted with their
language and customs. In these Calendars the fire-priest is constantly
referred to as <i>ah-toc</i>, literally &#8220;the fire-master.&#8221; The rites he
celebrates recur at regular intervals of twenty days (the length of one
native month) apart. They are four in number. On the first he takes the
fire; on the second he kindles the fire; on the third he gives it free
play, and on the fourth he extinguishes it. A period of five days is
then allowed to elapse, when these ceremonies are recommenced in the
same order. Whatever their meaning, they are so important that in the
<i>Buk Xoc</i>, or General Computation of the Calendar, preserved in the
mystic &#8220;Books of Chilan Balam,&#8221; there are special directions for these
fire-masters to reckon the proper periods for the exercise of their
strange functions.<a name="FNanchor_45-2_109" id="FNanchor_45-2_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_45-2_109" class="fnanchor">45-&#8224;</a></p>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_29" id="section_29"></a><b>29.</b> What, now, was the sentiment which underlay this worship of fire? I
think that the facts quoted, and especially the words of Father de Leon,
leave no doubt about it. Fire was worshiped as the life-giver, the
active generator, of animate existence. This idea was by no means
peculiar to them. It repeatedly recurs in Sanskrit, in Greek and in
Teutonic mythology, as has been ably pointed out by Dr. Hermann
Cohen.<a name="FNanchor_45-3_110" id="FNanchor_45-3_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_45-3_110" class="fnanchor">45-&#8225;</a> The fire-god Agni (<i>ignis</i>) is in the Vedas the Maker of
men; Prometheus steals the fire from heaven that he may with it animate
the human forms he has moulded of clay; even the connection of the
pulque with the fire is paralleled in Greek mythos, where Dionysos is
called <i>Pyrigenes</i>, the &#8220;fire-born.&#8221;</p>

<p>Among the ancient Aztecs the god of fire was called the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span> oldest of gods,
<i>Huehueteotl</i>, and also &#8220;Our Father,&#8221; <i>Tota</i>, as it was believed from

names was <i>Xiuhtecutli</i>, which can be translated &#8220;God of the Green
Leaf,&#8221; that is, of vegetable fecundity and productiveness.<a name="FNanchor_46-3_113" id="FNanchor_46-3_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_46-3_113" class="fnanchor">46-&#8225;</a></p>

<p>To transform themselves into a globe or ball of fire was, as we have
seen (ant&egrave;, p. 21), a power claimed by expert nagualists, and to handle
it with impunity, or to blow it from the mouth, was one of their
commonest exhibitions. Nothing so much proved their superiority as thus
to master this potent element.</p>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_30" id="section_30"></a><b>30.</b> The same name above referred to, &#8220;the Heart of the Town,&#8221; or &#8220;of the
Hills,&#8221; was that which at a comparatively late date was applied to an
idol of green stone preserved with religious care in a cavern in the
Cerro de Monopostiac, not far from San Francisco del Mar. The spot is
still believed by the natives to be enchanted ground and protected by
superhuman powers.<a name="FNanchor_46-4_114" id="FNanchor_46-4_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_46-4_114" class="fnanchor">46-&sect;</a></p>

<p>These green stones, called <i>chalchiuitl</i>, of jadeite, nephrite, green
quartz, or the like, were accounted of peculiar religious significance
throughout southern Mexico, and probably to this day many are preserved
among the indigenous population as amulets and charms. They were often
carved into images, either in human form or representing a frog, the
latter apparently the symbol of the waters and of fertility. Bartholom&egrave;
de Alva refers to them in a passage of his Confessionary. The priest
asks the penitent:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Dost thou possess at this very time little idols of green stone,
or frogs made of it (<i>in chalchiuh coconeme, chalchiuh
tamazoltin</i>)?</p>

<p>&#8220;Dost thou put them out in the sun to be warmed? Dost thou keep
them wrapped in cotton coverings, with great respect and
veneration?</p>

<p>&#8220;Dost thou believe, and hold for very truth, that these green
stones give thee food and drink, even as thy ancestors believed,
who died in their idolatry? Dost thou believe that they give thee
success and prosperity<span class='pagenum' style="font-size: 89%;"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span> and good things, and all that them hast or
wishest? Because we know very well that many of you so believe at
this very time.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_47-1_115" id="FNanchor_47-1_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_47-1_115" class="fnanchor">47-*</a></p></div>

<p>Down to quite a recent date, and perhaps still, these green stones are
employed in certain ceremonies in vogue among the Indians of Oaxaca in
order to ensure a plenteous maize harvest. The largest ear of corn in
the field is selected and wrapped up in a cloth with some of these
chalchiuite. At the next corn-planting it is taken to the field and
buried in the soil. This is believed to be a relic of the worship of the
ancient Zapotec divinity, Quiegolani, who presided over cultivated
fields.<a name="FNanchor_47-2_116" id="FNanchor_47-2_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_47-2_116" class="fnanchor">47-&#8224;</a></p>

<p>They are still in use among the natives as lucky stones or amulets. In
the Zotzil insurrection of 1869, already referred to, one was found
suspended to the neck of one of the slain Indians. It came into the
possession of M. Maler, who has described and figured it.<a name="FNanchor_47-3_117" id="FNanchor_47-3_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_47-3_117" class="fnanchor">47-&#8225;</a> It
represents a human head with a curious expression and a singular
headdress.</p>

<p>From specimens of these amulets preserved in museums it is seen that any
greenish stone was selected, preferably those yielding a high, vitreous
polish, as jadeite, turquoise, emerald, chlormelanite or precious
serpentine. The color gave the sacred character, and this, it seems to
me, was distinctly meant to be symbolic of water and its effects, the
green of growing plants, and hence of fertility, abundance and
prosperity.</p>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_31" id="section_31"></a><b>31.</b> There is another symbol, still venerated among the present
indigenous population, which belongs to Nagualism, and is a survival
from the ancient cult; this is the Tree. The species held in especial
respect is the ceiba, the silk-cotton tree, the <i>ytzamatl</i> (knife-leaved
paper tree) of the Nahuas, the <i>yax che</i> (green, or first tree) of the
Mayas, the <i>Bombax ceiba</i> of the botanists. It is of great size and
rapid growth. In Southern Mexico and Central America one is to be seen
near many of the native villages, and is regarded as in some way the
protecting genius of the town.</p>

life,&#8221; represented to have four branches, each sacred to one of the four
cardinal points and the divinities associated therewith.</p>

<p>The conventionalized form of this tree in the Mexican figurative
paintings strongly resembles a cross. Examples of it are numerous and
unmistakable, as, for instance, the cruciform tree of life rising from a
head with a protruding tongue, in the Vienna Codex.<a name="FNanchor_48-2_119" id="FNanchor_48-2_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_48-2_119" class="fnanchor">48-&#8224;</a></p>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_32" id="section_32"></a><b>32.</b> Thus, the sign of the cross, either the form with equal arms known
as the cross of St. Andrew, which is the oldest Christian form, or the
Latin cross, with its arms of unequal length, came to be the ideogram
for &#8220;life&#8221; in the Mexican hieroglyphic writing; and as such, with more
or less variants, was employed to signify the <i>tonalli</i> or <i>nagual</i>, the
sign of nativity, the natal day, the personal spirit.<a name="FNanchor_48-3_120" id="FNanchor_48-3_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_48-3_120" class="fnanchor">48-&#8225;</a> The
ancient document called the Mappe Quinatzin offers examples, and its
meaning is explained by various early writers. The peculiar character of
the Mexican ritual calendar, by which nativities were calculated,
favored a plan of representing them in the shape of a cross; as we see
in the singular <i>Codex Cruciformis</i> of the Boturini-Goupil collection.</p>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_33" id="section_33"></a><b>33.</b> But the doctrines of Nagualism had a phase even more detestable to
the missionaries than any of these, an esoteric phase, which brought it
into relation to the libidinous cults of Babylon and the orgies of the
&#8220;Witches&#8217; Sabbaths&#8221; of the Dark Ages. Of these occult practices we of
course have no detailed descriptions, but there are hints and
half-glances which leave us in no doubt.</p>

<p>When the mysterious metamorphosis of the individual into his or her
<i>nagual</i> was about to take place, the person must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span> strip to absolute
nudity;<a name="FNanchor_49-1_121" id="FNanchor_49-1_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_49-1_121" class="fnanchor">49-*</a> and the lascivious fury of bands of naked Nagualists,
meeting in remote glades by starlight or in the dark recesses of caves,
dancing before the statues of the ancient gods, were scenes that stirred
the fanaticism of the Spanish missionaries to its highest pitch. Bishop
Landa informs us that in Yucatan the dance there known as the <i>naual</i>
was one of the few in which both men and women took part, and that it
&#8220;was not very decent.&#8221; It was afterwards prohibited by the priests. We
have excellent authority that such wild rites continued well into the
present century, close to the leading cities of the State,<a name="FNanchor_49-2_122" id="FNanchor_49-2_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_49-2_122" class="fnanchor">49-&#8224;</a> and
it is highly likely that they are not unknown to-day.</p>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_34" id="section_34"></a><b>34.</b> Moreover, it is certain that among the Nagualists, one of their most
revered symbols was the <i>serpent</i>; in Chiapas, one of their highest
orders of the initiated was that of the <i>chanes</i>, or serpents. Not only
is this in Christian symbolism the form and sign of the Prince of Evil
and the enemy of God, but the missionaries were aware that in the
astrological symbols of ancient Mexico the serpent represented the
<i>phallus</i>; that it was regarded as the most potent of all the
signs;<a name="FNanchor_49-3_123" id="FNanchor_49-3_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_49-3_123" class="fnanchor">49-&#8225;</a> and modern research has shown, contrary to the opinion
long held, that there was among these nations an extraordinary and
extensive worship of the reciprocal principle of nature, associated with
numerous phallic emblems.<a name="FNanchor_49-4_124" id="FNanchor_49-4_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_49-4_124" class="fnanchor">49-&sect;</a></p>

<p>Huge phalli of stone have been discovered, one, for instance, on the
Cerro de las Navajas, not far from the city of Mexico,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span> and another in
the State of Hidalgo.<a name="FNanchor_50-1_125" id="FNanchor_50-1_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_50-1_125" class="fnanchor">50-*</a> Probably they were used in some such
ceremonies as Oviedo describes among the Nahuas of Nicaragua, where the
same symbol was represented by conical mounds of earth, around which at
certain seasons the women danced with libidinous actions. Although as a
general rule the pottery of ancient Mexico avoids obscenity, Brasseur
stated that he had seen many specimens of a contrary character from
certain regions,<a name="FNanchor_50-2_126" id="FNanchor_50-2_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_50-2_126" class="fnanchor">50-&#8224;</a> and Dr. Berendt has copied several striking
examples, showing curious <i>yoni</i> symbols, which are now in my
possession.</p>

<p>We may explain these as in some way connected with the worship of
Pantecatl, the male divinity who presided over profligate love, and of
Tlazolteotl, the <i>Venus Impudica</i> of the Aztec pantheon; and it is not
without significance that the cave-temple of Votan, whose contents were
destroyed by the Bishop of Chiapas, in 1691 (see above, <a href="#Page_39">p. 39</a>), was
located at <i>Tlazoaloyan</i>, both names being derived from a root
signifying sexual action.<a name="FNanchor_50-3_127" id="FNanchor_50-3_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_50-3_127" class="fnanchor">50-&#8225;</a> The other name of the divinity,
called &#8220;the Heart of the Hills,&#8221; is in Quiche, Alom, &#8220;he who begets,&#8221;
and the Zapotec Cozaana, another analogue of the same deity, is
translated by Seler, &#8220;the Begetter.&#8221; Such facts indicate how intimately
the esoteric doctrines of Nagualism were related to the worship of the
reproductive powers of nature.</p>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_35" id="section_35"></a><b>35.</b> It will readily be understood from what has been said that Nagualism
was neither a pure descendant of the ancient cults, nor yet a derivative
from Christian doctrines and European superstitions. It was a strange
commingling of both, often in grotesque and absurd forms. In fact, the
pretended Christianity of the native population of Mexico to-day is
little more than a figment, according to the testimony of the most
competent observers.<a name="FNanchor_50-4_128" id="FNanchor_50-4_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_50-4_128" class="fnanchor">50-&sect;</a></p>

<p>The rituals and prayers of the nagualists bear witness to this. It is
very visible in those I have quoted from Nu&ntilde;ez de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span> la Vega, and I can
add an interesting example of it which has not heretofore been
published. I take it from the MSS. of Father Vicente Hernandez Spina,
cura of Ixtlavacan, in Guatemala, a remote village of the Quiches. He
wrote it down in the native tongue about forty years ago, as recited by
an <i>ah-kih</i>, &#8220;reader of days,&#8221; a native master of the genethliac art,
who had composed it in favor of a client who had asked his intercession.</p>

<p class="titlepage"><i>Prayer of an Ah-Kih.</i></p>

<p>Most of such invocations are expressed in terms far more recondite and
symbolic than the above. We have many such preserved in the work of
Jacinto de la Serna, which supply ample material to acquaint us with the
peculiarities of the sacred and secret language of the nagualists. I

<p>From the same work of de la Serna I collect the following list of
symbolic expressions. It might easily be extended, but these will be
sufficient to show the figurative obscurities which they threw around
their formulas of conjuration, but which were by no means devoid of
coherence and instruction to those who could understand them.</p>

rise<span class='pagenum' style="font-size: 89%;"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> from it); &#8220;the rabbit with its mouth upward&#8221; (the rabbit, in
opposition to the one they see in the moon; with its mouth upward,
because of the mists which rise from it like the breath exhaled
from the mouth); &#8220;the flower which contains everything&#8221; (as all
fruit proceeds from flowers, so does all vegetable life proceed
from the earth, which is therefore spoken of as a flower); &#8220;the
flower which bites the mouths&#8221; (a flower, for the reason given; it
eats the mouths, because all things necessarily return to it, and
are swallowed by it).</p>

<p><i>Fingers.</i>&mdash;&#8220;The five fates,&#8221; or &#8220;the five works,&#8221; or &#8220;the five
fields&#8221; (because by the use of his fingers man works out his own
destiny. Hence also the worship of the Hand among the Nahuas as the
god Maitl, and among the Mayas as the god Kab, both which words
mean &#8220;hand&#8221;).</p>

<p><i>The Maguey Plant.</i>&mdash;&#8220;My sister, the eight in a row&#8221; (because it
was planted in this manner).</p>

<p><i>A Road.</i>&mdash;&#8220;That which is divided in two, and yet has neither
beginning, middle nor end&#8221; (because it always lies in two

moisture); &#8220;our Mother, whose robe is of precious stones&#8221; (from the
green or vegetable life resembling the turquoise, emerald, jade,
etc.).</p></div>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_36" id="section_36"></a><b>36.</b> It might be asked how the dark arts and secret ceremonies of the
Nagualists escaped the prying eyes of the officers of the Holy
Inquisition, which was established in Mexico in 1571. The answer is,
that the inquisitors were instructed by Cardinal Diego de Espinosa, who
at that time was Inquisitor General and President of the Council of the
Indies, &#8220;to abstain from proceedings against Indians, because of their
stupidity and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span> incapacity, as well as scant instruction in the Holy
Catholic faith, for the crimes of heresy, apostasy, heretical blasphemy,
sorcery, incantations, superstitions,&#8221; etc.</p>

<p>Energetic inquisitors, however, conceded very grudgingly this exemption.
In the imposing <i>auto de f&eacute;</i> celebrated in the city of Mexico, in 1659,
a half-breed, Bernardo del Carpio by name, son of a full-blood Indian
mother, accused of blasphemy, etc., endeavored to escape the Holy Office
by pleading his Indian blood; but his appeal was disallowed, and the
precedent established that any admixture whatever of European blood
brought the accused within the jurisdiction of the Inquisition.<a name="FNanchor_55-1_130" id="FNanchor_55-1_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_55-1_130" class="fnanchor">55-*</a>
Even this seems to have been a concession, for we find the record of an
<i>auto de f&eacute;</i> held in 1609, in the province of Tehuantepec, in which
eight full-blood natives were punished for worshiping the goddess
Pinopiaa.<a name="FNanchor_55-2_131" id="FNanchor_55-2_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_55-2_131" class="fnanchor">55-&#8224;</a> Mr. David Ferguson, however, who has studied
extensively the records of the inquisition in Mexico, informs me that in
none of the trials read by him has he observed any charges of Nagualism,
although many white persons were accused, and some tried, for consulting
Indian sorcerers.</p>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_37" id="section_37"></a><b>37.</b> It will be seen from what I have said, that the rites of Nagualism
extended as widely as did the term over Mexico and Central America. It
becomes, therefore, of importance to discover from what linguistic stock
this term and its associated words are derived. From that source it is
reasonable to suppose the rites of this superstition also had their
origin.</p>

<p>The opinions on this subject have been diverse and positive. Most
writers have assumed that it is a Nahuatl, or pure Mexican, word; while
an eminent authority, Dr. Stoll, is not less certain that it is from a
radical belonging to the neighboring great stock of the Mayan dialects,
and especially the Quiche, of Guatemala.<a name="FNanchor_55-3_132" id="FNanchor_55-3_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_55-3_132" class="fnanchor">55-&#8225;</a> Perhaps both these
positions are erroneous, and we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span> must look elsewhere for the true
etymology of these expressions. Unquestionably they had become
domesticated in both Maya and Nahuatl; but there is some reason to think
they were loan-words, belonging to another, and perhaps more venerable,
civilization than either of these nations could claim.</p>

<p>To illustrate this I shall subjoin several series of words derived from
the same radical which is at the basis of the word nagual, the series,
three in number, being taken from the three radically diverse, though
geographically contiguous, linguistic stocks, the Maya, the Zapotec and
the Nahuatl.</p>

<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_38" id="section_38"></a><b>38.</b> I believe that no one can carefully examine these lists of words,
all taken from authorities well acquainted with the several tongues, and
writing when they still retained their original purity, without
acknowledging that the same radical or syllable underlies them all; and
further, that from the primitive form and rich development of this
radical in the Zapotec, it looks as if we must turn to it to recognize
the origin of all these expressions, both in the Nahuatl and the Maya
linguistic stocks.</p>

<p>The root <i>na</i>, to know, is the primitive monosyllabic stem to which we
trace all of them. <i>Nahual</i> means knowledge, especially mystic
knowledge, the Gnosis, the knowledge of the hidden and secret things of
nature; easily enough confounded in uncultivated minds with sorcery and
magic.<a name="FNanchor_57-1_133" id="FNanchor_57-1_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_57-1_133" class="fnanchor">57-*</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>It is very significant that neither the radical <i>na</i> nor any of its
derivatives are found in the Huasteca dialect of the Mayan tongue, which
was spoken about Tampico, far removed from other members of the stock.
The inference is that in the southern dialects it was a borrowed stem.</p>

<p>Nor in the Nahuatl language&mdash;although its very name is derived from
it<a name="FNanchor_58-1_134" id="FNanchor_58-1_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_58-1_134" class="fnanchor">58-*</a>&mdash;does the radical <i>na</i> appear in its simplicity and true
significance. To the Nahuas, also, it must have been a loan.</p>

<p>It is true that de la Serna derives the Mexican <i>naualli</i>, a sorcerer,
from the verb <i>nahualtia</i>, to mask or disguise oneself, &#8220;because a
<i>naualli</i> is one who masks or disguises himself under the form of some
lower animal, which is his <i>nagual</i>;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_58-2_135" id="FNanchor_58-2_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_58-2_135" class="fnanchor">58-&#8224;</a> but it is altogether
likely that <i>nahualtia</i> derived its meaning from the custom of the
medicine men to wear masks during their ceremonies.</p>

<p>Therefore, if the term <i>nagual</i>, and many of its associates and
derivatives, were at first borrowed from the Zapotec language, a
necessary <a name="corr6" title="corr6"></a><ins class="correction" title="corollary">corrollary</ins> of this conclusion is, that along with these
terms came most of the superstitions, rites and beliefs to which they
allude; which thus became grafted on the general tendency to such
superstitions existing everywhere and at all times in the human mind.</p>

<p>Along with the names of the days and the hieroglyphs which mark them,
and the complicated arithmetical methods by means of which they were
employed, were carried most of the doctrines of the Nagualists, and the
name by which they in time became known from central Mexico quite to
Nicaragua and beyond.</p>

<p>The mysterious words have now, indeed, lost much of their ancient
significance. In a recent dictionary of the Spanish of Mexico <i>nagual</i>
is defined as &#8220;a witch; a word used to frighten children and make them
behave,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_58-3_136" id="FNanchor_58-3_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_58-3_136" class="fnanchor">58-&#8225;</a> while in Nicaragua, where the former Nahuatl
population has left so many traces of its presence in the language of
to-day, the word <i>nagual</i> no longer means an actor in the black art, or
a knowledge of it, but his or her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span> armamentarium, or the box, jar or
case in which are kept the professional apparatus, the talismans and
charms, which constitute the stock in trade or outfit of the
necromancer.<a name="FNanchor_59-1_137" id="FNanchor_59-1_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_59-1_137" class="fnanchor">59-*</a></p>

<p>Among the Lacandons, of Mayan stock, who inhabit the forests on the
upper waters of the Usumacinta river, at the present day the term
<i>naguate</i> or <i>nagutlat</i> is said to be applied to any one &#8220;who is
entitled to respect and obedience by age and merit;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_59-2_138" id="FNanchor_59-2_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_59-2_138" class="fnanchor">59-&#8224;</a> but in all
probability he is also believed to possess superior and occult
knowledge.</p>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_39" id="section_39"></a><b>39.</b> All who have any acquaintance with the folk-lore of the world are
aware that the notion of men and women having the power to change
themselves into beasts is as wide as superstition itself and older than
history. It is mentioned in the pages of Herodotus and in the myths of
ancient Assyria. It is the property of African negroes, and the
peasantry of Europe still hold to their faith in the reality of the
were-wolf of Germany, the <i>loup-garou</i> of France and the <i>lupo mannaro</i>
of Italy. Dr. Richard Andr&eacute;e well says in his interesting study of the
subject: &#8220;He who would explain the origin of this strange superstition
must not approach it as a national or local manifestation, but as one
universal in its nature; not as the property of one race or family, but
of the species and its psychology at large.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_59-3_139" id="FNanchor_59-3_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_59-3_139" class="fnanchor">59-&#8225;</a></p>

<p>Even in such a detail as the direct connection of the name of the person
with his power of change do we find extraordinary parallelisms between
the superstition of the red man of America and the peasant of Germany.
As in Mexico the <i>nagual</i> was assigned to the infant by a form of
baptism, so in Europe the peasants of east Prussia hold that if the
godparent at the time of naming and baptism thinks of a wolf, the infant
will acquire the power of becoming one; and in Hesse to pronounce the
name of the person in the presence of the animal into which he has been
changed will restore him to human shape.<a name="FNanchor_59-4_140" id="FNanchor_59-4_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_59-4_140" class="fnanchor">59-&sect;</a></p>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_40" id="section_40"></a><b>40.</b> I need not say that the doctrine of personal spirits is not
especially Mexican, nor yet American; it belongs to man in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span> general, and
can be recognized in most religions and many philosophies. In ancient
Greece both the Platonicians and later the Neo-Platonicians thought that
each individual has a particular spirit, or <i>daim&#333;n</i>, in whom is
enshrined his or her moral personality. To this <i>daim&#333;n</i> he should
address his prayers, and should listen heedfully to those interior
promptings which seem to arise in the mind from some unseen silent
monitor.<a name="FNanchor_60-1_141" id="FNanchor_60-1_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_60-1_141" class="fnanchor">60-*</a></p>

<p>Many a member of the Church of Rome substitutes for the <i>daim&#333;n</i> of
the Platonists the patron saint after whom he is named, or whom he has
chosen from the calendar, the hagiology, of his Church. This analogy did
not fail to strike the early missionaries, and they saw in the Indian
priest selecting the <i>nagual</i> of the child a hideous and diabolical
caricature of the holy rites.</p>

<p>But what was their horror when they found that the similarity proceeded
so far that the pagan priest also performed a kind of baptismal
sacrament with water; and that in the Mexican picture-writing the sign
which represents the natal day, the <i>tonal</i>, by which the individual
demon is denoted, was none other than the sign of the cross, as we have
seen. This left no doubt as to the devilish origin of the whole
business, which was further supported by the wondrous thaumaturgic
powers of its professors.</p>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_41" id="section_41"></a><b>41.</b> How are we to explain these marvelous statements? It will not do to
take the short and easy road of saying they are all lies and frauds. The
evidence is too abundant for us to doubt that there was skillful
jugglery among the proficients in the occult arts among those nations.
They could rival their colleagues in the East Indies and Europe, if not
surpass them.</p>

<p>Moreover, is there anything incredible in the reports of the spectators?
Are we not familiar with the hypnotic or mesmeric conditions in which
the subject sees, hears and feels just what the master tells him to feel
and see? The tricks of cutting oneself or others, of swallowing broken
glass, of handling venomous reptiles, are well-known performances of the
sect of the Aissaoua in northern Africa, and nowadays one does not have
to go off the boulevards of Paris to see them repeated. The phenomena of
thought transference, of telepathy, of clairvoy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>ance, of spiritual
rappings, do but reiterate under the clear light of the close of the
nineteenth century the mystical thaumaturgy with which these children of
nature were familiar centuries ago in the New World, and which are
recorded of the theosophists and magicians of Egypt, Greece and
Rome.<a name="FNanchor_61-1_142" id="FNanchor_61-1_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_61-1_142" class="fnanchor">61-*</a> So long as many intelligent and sensible people among
ourselves find all explanations of these modern phenomena inadequate and
unsatisfactory, we may patiently wait for a complete solution of those
of a greater antiquity.</p>


<p class="sectionhead"><a name="section_42" id="section_42"></a><b>42.</b> The conclusion to which this study of Nagualism leads is, that it
was not merely the belief in a personal guardian spirit, as some have
asserted; not merely a survival of fragments of the ancient heathenism,
more or less diluted by Christian teachings, as others have maintained;
but that above and beyond these, it was a powerful secret organization,
extending over a wide area, including members of different languages and
varying culture, bound together by mystic rites, by necromantic powers
and occult doctrines; but, more than all, by one intense emotion&mdash;hatred
of the whites&mdash;and by one unalterable purpose&mdash;that of their
destruction, and with them the annihilation of the government and
religion which they had introduced.</p>

infant was bled from a vein behind the ear, assigned a name, that of a
certain day, and a guardian angel or <i>tona</i>. These words are pure

(medicinal cosa), <i>pox</i>, <i>xpoxtacoghbil</i>; for physician (medico),
<i>ghpoxta vinic</i> (the form <i>vanegh</i>, person, is also correct). The
Tzendal <i>pox</i> (pronounced <i>p&#333;sh</i>) is another form of the
Quiche-Cakchiquel <i>p&#363;z</i>, a word which Father Ximenes, in his
<i>Vocabulario Cakchiquel</i> MS (in my possession), gives in the compound
<i>puz naual</i>, with the meaning, enchanter, wizard. Both these, I take it,
are derived from the Maya <i>puz</i>, which means to blow the dust, etc., off
of something (soplar el polvo de la ropa &oacute; otra cosa. <i>Dicc. de la
Lengua Maya del Convento de Motul</i>, MS. The dictionary edited by Pio
Perez does not give this meaning). The act of blowing was the essential
feature in the treatment of these medicine men. It symbolized the
transfer and exercise of spiritual power. When Votan built his
underground shrine he did it <i>&agrave; soplos</i>, by blowing (Nu&ntilde;ez de la Vega,
<i>Constitut. Diocesan</i>, p. 10). The natives did not regard the comet&#8217;s
tail as behind it but in front of it, blown from its mouth. The Nahuatl
word in the text, <i>tzihuizin</i>, is the Pipil form of <i>xihuitzin</i>, the
reverential of <i>xihuitl</i>, which means a leaf, a season, a year, or a
comet. Apparently it refers to the Nahuatl divinity <i>Xiuht&eacute; cutli</i>,
described by Sahagun, <i>Historia de Nueva Espa&ntilde;a</i>, Lib. i, cap. 13, as
god of fire, etc.</p>

a variety of cat-tail rush which the Apaches in a similar manner throw
into the fire as an offering. Hernandez, however, describes the
<i>yiahuitli</i> as a plant with red flowers, growing on mountains and
hill-sides&mdash;no species of rush, therefore. De la Serna says it is the
anise plant, and that with it the natives perform the conjuration of the
&#8220;yellow spirit&#8221; (conjuro de amarillo espiritado), that is, of the Fire

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
